The character is so firmly ensconced in his own view of reality that even the smallest exposure allows a small crack to worm its way into his perceptions. Stepping into the Hedge brings flooding memories of the weird logic of fae reality, where one can never entirely trust one’s senses and time and space can flow like a river in a spring thaw.",
            "Maintaining a Clarity rating this high requires a character establish a routine to his life that gives structure and order to contrast the chaos of Faerie. Upsets in this careful regimen can shake the changeling’s perception of a patterned, ordered reality. Being fired from a part-time job, breaking up with a short-term girlfriend or moving to another neighborhood in the same town are all examples of these minor unexpected life changes. Changes need not be negative, either: a promotion at work or making contact with an old friend after several years also count."

Should she attempt to call on a token, though, her mind rushes back to the bizarre and wondrous treasures her Keeper possessed and may have forced her to use (or used on her). Invoking the power of a token comes too close to the memory of her Keeper’s web of pledges, promises and vows.",
            "Humans are social creatures, and we crave contact with our own kind. Changelings may not be human any more, but they still must spend time with mortal men and women occasionally, if only to have contact with someone who can confirm that the changelings’ perceptions of reality are, in fact, correct.",
            "The True Fae embody whim, caprice and total self-absorption. Selfish acts, even minor ones such as refusing to help a friend move because you’d rather catch the game or not stopping to help a stranded (but not endangered) motorist, remind changelings uncomfortably of the way their Keepers acted."

            "Changelings are creatures of Wyrd, perhaps not to the same extent as the Others, but changelings are nonetheless bound by its power. At Clarity 8, a changeling knows that she cannot deny the fae side of her nature and just try to pass herself off as human. Even breaking a promise not enforced by the power of the Wyrd is a breaking point, usually accompanied by a memory of a particularly harsh lesson from her Keeper on the importance of honoring her word. For mundane promises, Storytellers should be fairly lenient: “I’ll see you for dinner on Thursday” isn’t a promise strong enough to trigger a breaking point, but “I promise I’ll be there this time” is. In matters of changeling society, be stricter: promises carry more weight among the Courts, and a lightly made promise to another of the Lost carries more weight than a promise to a mortal.",
            "A changeling’s Court is more than just a group of like-minded fellow Lost she spends time with. Choosing a Court is a serious commitment, one the changeling is expected to honor. Just as breaking a promise, changing Courts clashes against a changeling’s Wyrd-infused nature.",
            "Inflicting injury on another is a hallmark of the Gentry. Whether they are truly sadistic or simply uncaring, they cause pain and sorrow without a second thought. When a changeling commits such an act herself, she feels a moment of chilling kinship with her Keeper that shakes her to the core. In some ways, accidental violence is even worse than deliberate cruelty, as it echoes the Others’ lack of care for anyone or anything other than themselves."

The changeling plunges into a nightmare realm of hallucinations, memories of her durance made horribly real by the drugs’ influence.",

The Gentry care nothing for the comfort of their servants, or even for their lives; thus, to kill another changeling is to take the power of the Others into your own hands. That sort of monumental callousness can crack a changeling’s resolve like a mirror, driving him deeper into his delusions.",

A fetch is, at least in some measure, a part of the changeling the fetch was sent to replace. Fashioned of shadow and Glamour and assorted detritus, the Fetch nevertheless takes on the human life of its double, living as a normal woman while the changeling suffers her durance in Arcadia. It doesn’t take a poet to see the metaphor inherent in killing your mundane, mortal life."

For a changeling to deny his Wyrd is every bit as detrimental as it is for him to deny his humanity. Breaking a pledge counts as a level 4 breaking point, meaning the changeling must roll a degeneration check with three dice in addition to any detrimental sanctions built into the pledge itself and the effects of breaking an oath, if applicable. Changelings do not give their word lightly, and with good reason.",
            "Extreme unexpected life changes can shake a changeling to the very core of his being. Unlike minor and serious unexpected changes, extreme life changes are seldom, if ever, beneficial. Losing your home and everything you own to a fire or flood, the death of one or more motley members or relocating to another country are all examples of extreme life changes. Pregnancy typically falls under this level as well — and it should be noted that women aren’t the only ones for whom pregnancy is an extreme life change. Unless the changeling father skips out and abandons his family, he must roll as well. Sadly, more often than not, this means that changelings are absentee fathers at best and deadbeat dads at worst."

            "In the nightmare realm of Faerie, changelings suffer at the whims of their Keepers, who shape the reality of that world as easily as a changeling shapes the dreams of a mortal. It’s not hard to see, then, why a changeling who ravages a mortal’s dreams encounters a breaking point when she sees how her actions mirror those of the Gentry. Moreover, since most changelings must enter into a pledge to ride a mortal’s dreams, on top of the capricious inflicting of harm on a human being, there is the added sting of betrayal.",
            "Prolonged periods of solitude with no human interaction can drive even a perfectly sane person a little batty, so it’s no surprise that changelings suffer a more severe breaking point when they go for a month or longer without human contact. Such a long time without any contact other than the fae can make a changeling begin to wonder whether she’s even left Faerie at all. She may begin to forget basic nuances of human behavior or display inappropriate emotional reactions.",
            "Kidnapping, obviously, is the formative event of nearly every changeling’s existence. Even those who were not technically abducted but who wandered into the Hedge by accident or caprice recall that pivotal moment when they first encountered their Keepers and were snatched away. Kidnapping a mortal, no matter how altruistic the intentions, brings those memories crashing back and can leave even the most stalwart of changelings a quivering, sobbing wreck. It should be noted that the legal definition of kidnapping does not apply here; the key factor in whether the act is a breaking point is the subject’s willingness to go with the changeling. Taking a teenaged motley member out of the foster home he was placed in is legally kidnapping, since the child’s guardians didn’t consent, but it wouldn’t be a breaking point.",
            "A changeling’s mind is a surprisingly fragile thing. Already prone to madness by virtue of the Glamour that courses through changelings, a changeling has little to guide her beyond her own perceptions of reality. If those perceptions are skewed by the acquisition of a derangement (from a source other than a Clarity degeneration), she suffers a further break from reality. She may remember a time in her durance when the pain or humiliation drove her mad, or she might experience grueling flashes of the sheer random illogic that are the Others’ bread and butter."

            "When a changeling kills a human, it is more than an act of simple manslaughter. The killing of a human being is the ultimate act of True-Fae-like hubris: the assertion that the changeling has total dominion over the life of a human being, one ignorant of the hidden world that lurks just behind her perception. That by itself is not enough to justify the sheer intensity of this breaking point; much of the same argument could be applied to the killing of another changeling, a Clarity 5 breaking point. What separates the killing of a human is what it represents: in a sense, by killing a human being, the changeling divorces his identity from humanity for a moment. Killing a human being is tantamount to denying that he ever was human, which drives his mind toward the inhuman madness of his Keeper.",
            "Casual or callous crimes fall under the same justification: by committing depraved acts, the changeling makes himself more like his Keeper than the changeling would likely care to admit. It is somewhat easier to justify these acts against other supernatural beings, since they occupy the same “unreal” niche that other changelings do. Clarity is maintained because the changeling can identify other supernatural beings as part of his deluded perception of reality. Even if he knows, intellectually, that a werewolf or vampire is every bit as real as the changeling is, the madness that haunts him always leaves that niggling doubt in the back of his mind: just how real is he, anyways?"

            "Clarity 1 breaking points are the sort of events that can destroy a changeling’s sanity in a heartbeat. Mercifully, the triggering events for most are extremely rare in most chronicles. Spending time in Arcadia usually means the chronicle is over for that character, but in the rare instance that a chronicle journeys to the Realm of the Fae and returns, time spent in Arcadia is a constant reminder of the horrors the changeling endured. Every glance is heavy with memories, and in the unlikely event that a changeling is able to sleep his dreams are wracked by vivid, specific nightmares as though the veil of forgetfulness has been ripped away. Should it become necessary to roll, assume that a changeling must make a degeneration roll using two dice each time a number of days equal to his Wyrd passes in Arcadia (that’s days of perceived, Arcadian time, which may not be the same thing as Earthly time at all). High-Wyrd changelings are more adapted to the riot of Arcadia and can keep their wits about them longer.",
            "Prolonged contact with the True Fae is likewise a frequent chronicle-ender, but less often than journeying to Arcadia. Banished Fae lurk in the mortal world, and they still count as members of the Gentry, and the true Lords of Faerie sometimes manifest in this realm for their own ends. Prolonged contact (or intimate contact of any duration) calls up the strongest and bitterest memories of captivity, making the changeling relive her greatest hurts and humiliations. The very presence of one of the Others warps the changeling’s perceptions and cracks her will like delicate china.",
            "For purposes of degeneration, “prolonged contact” requires at least an hour of interaction. Doing battle with one of the Gentry typically doesn’t count unless it is a truly epic combat. The exception is if the changeling encounters the True Fae in Arcadia, the Hedge or a dreamscape. In those realms where the Fae reign supreme, even a short scene’s worth of contact counts. Note also that this breaking point is cumulative with spending time in Arcadia. A changeling who visits Faerie and encounters one of the Gentry there must make two degeneration rolls."
