Each of the great Courts claims to have originated these clauses; while Summer Courtiers swear the shared history of their Court and these powers should be self-evident, the Lost of the Ashen Mirror often claim to have crafted it to beat the Iron Spear at its own game. Nobody mentions the fact that the Gentry so often have affection for powers just like these.',

            'Unlike other Contracts, Hearth Contracts don’t have a catch. They always cost some amount of Glamour and/or Willpower to invoke. To the contrary, Contracts of Hearth have a ban. That is, the Faerie entities that grant the favors of Hearth can, if their ire is aroused, turn those boons right around and use them to blight the individual. The specific bans are described here with each power, but the faerie host is notoriously ill-tempered when its goodwill is abused. Therefore, the Storyteller has a lot of leeway when to apply the punishment of broken bans. Such retribution always seems to come at the worst possible time.',
            'Many changelings suspect that these bans came about because the Hearth entities with whom the Fair Folk made their original bargains somehow obtained for themselves the better part of the compact between themselves and the fae. It stands to reason, given the nature of these Contracts. (Note also that certain bans may be manipulated for the purposes of causing failure when success would normally be warranted. Granted, the changeling must know that his subject has already received the benefits of one of these Hearth Contracts, but such secrets are easy enough to discern. Indeed, using some of these Contracts in this reverse manner adds a bit of versatility to the Hearth powers. On the other hand, trying to force this ill fate on the same subject more than once alerts the powers of Fate to the fact that they’re being manipulated. The punishment treatment then applies to the changeling attempting to invoke the anti-Contract, as opposed to the desired subject of the anti-Contract.)',

            'One of the biggest challenges any changeling faces is dealing with the ever-present memories of their durance. Try as they might to leave their past behind them, unexpected reminders creep through the tiniest cracks in the Lost psyche, each one with the potential to breech the dam of pseudo-humanity that a changeling wraps around himself upon returning Faerie. Shoring up that dam, bolstering one’s own Clarity, or that of others, is the nominal purpose of this Contract, and the only one that most Lost will ever admit to using them for. Any tool, however, can be dangerous in the wrong hands, which is why many changelings will not speak of, let alone learn, these powers.',
            'The use of Contracts of Lucidity is an inherently slippery moral slope. Meddling in other’s perceptions (or tinkering too much with your own) can easily trigger best-forgotten memories of one’s time in Arcadia, which can only further degrade one’s grasp on reality. Because of this, each clause within the Contract has its own price, a Clarity breaking point which must be rolled against each time the clause is successfully activated. Those who make frequent use of these Contracts often find their Clarity slipping as a result of the constant challenges to it. Which, of course, encourages them to use them more often to bolster, support, or supplement their slipping grasp on reason and coherency. A dangerous cycle, but one which some Lost feel is a necessary evil if they are to survive the ever-growing dangers they face.',
            '<b>The Dangerous Secret:</b> The Contract of Lucidity wasn’t sworn with the force of Lucidity. It was sworn with the force of Madness. There is no force of Lucidity within the Hedge or Arcadia. Changelings tell themselves that this Contract is one forged with the guiding principle of mental stability, but deep down they know the truth. One doesn’t measure a changeling’s Clarity (such as they understand the term) by how lucid he is. One estimates his Clarity by how touched by delirium he is. Or, to be fair, how much he’s managed to elude that touch... so far.',
            '<b>Using Contracts of Clarity for Healing Mental Health:</b> If Storytellers are using the optional rules that cover detailed mechanics for aiding a Lost in regaining their Clarity (pp. 80-81 of Rites of Spring), some of the Contracts of Clarity may aid in these efforts. A counselor who is able to accurately assess her subject’s current Clarity has a better idea of where to focus her therapeutic efforts. Thus, a successful application of Read Clarity on a subject by a counselor gives her a +1 dice bonus to any future counseling challenges.',

The Wrong Foot does not change the appearance of previously made marks, however. Therefore, this limits the practical application of the Contract in numerous situations, so many changelings have come to rely on The Wrong Foot to leave a sort of “calling card,” whether or not they wish to obfuscate pursuit.

Few fae magics are as blatant and impressive as this clause, and its use has been known to violate freehold oaths that put a particularly heavy emphasis on secrecy.'

        "FullCatch": [
            'The character transplants a small hedge bush from a rural locale to the location where the Contract is to be used immediately prior (within the scene) to using the Contract. While the bush obviously need not be taken from the ground in the same scene, it must still be alive when planted.'

        "Roll Results": [
            '<b>Dramatic Failure:</b> The hedge fortification grows wildly in a manner that benefits the character’s enemies, whether by separating the character’s motley or cutting off his retreat. If a dramatic failure of this clause occurs in the Hedge, the walls of that maze suddenly open a trod that leads directly to Arcadia and alerts the Gentry to the character’s presence.',
            '<b>Failure:</b> The fortifications fail to appear. If used in the Hedge, failure on this clause counts as a dramatic failure.',
            '<b>Success:</b> Hedge walls erupt around the character, forming a maze. The character has a huge amount of control over the growth of the hedges, allowing for a great deal of versatility, but the following rules apply:',
            'The walls summoned forth are two feet thick and too tightly grown to allow someone to pass through without using a machete or other tool. The walls provide substantial concealment (-3) against firearms attacks (and only firearms — other ranged attacks can’t penetrate) and prevent close combat attacks. This Contract cannot be used inside the bounds of a human building, even one open to the sky (like a stadium). Whatever design the changeling gives the walls, they are always vertical, meaning that someone within the maze can always climb out (though a clever changeling might use this clause under an overpass, effectively cutting off the escape route above). The walls can be climbed, but the plants shift to prevent individuals from walking across the top of them. A character attempting to do so rolls Dexterity + Athletics each turn; she may move at a Speed equal to her successes on the roll, which counts as an instant action. Failure on the roll means the character makes no progress, while dramatic failure sends her plummeting back to the maze floor.',
            'The changeling determines the height of the walls, which can range from the changeling’s Wyrd to 10 + the changeling’s Wyrd in feet. If the height of the walls is obstructed, they stop at that height (rather than spreading outward or punching their way through barriers). The length of the barrier can be as small as Wyrd yards and as long as Wyrd times 10 yards. Furthermore, the barrier must be a single unbroken wall and must touch the changeling at least one single point when created (in other words, it cannot be created at range, but the changeling can put the whole of the barrier between himself and his enemies). Finally, the walls of the hedge maze must allow room for those within to move; no wall surface can be closer than three yards to another (and circular structures must have a diameter of three yards). Otherwise, the changeling’s imagination determines the layout of the fortifications. He might create a confusing maze, a simple barrier, a wall to funnel enemies down one side of an alleyway, or even a circular fortification to trap enemies within.',
            'The barriers last for a number of turns equal to the successes rolled on the activation roll. By spending one Willpower point, the changeling can extend this duration to the end of the scene. At the end of the duration (whether in turns or at the end of the scene), the changeling may expend two points of Glamour to maintain the hedge maze for another duration of the same length. The power ends, however, at dawn or sunset, whichever comes first.',
            'These hedges can be empowered by the other clauses of this Contract. Using Briarpath on the maze hedge applies that clause across all of the walls (as well as the top of the walls), but not across the ground within the maze. Leechweed results in any contact with the hedge walls seeping Glamour from the changeling who did so. The Shield of Thorns clause results in the appearance of small tendrils along the walls that strike at anyone who touches the wall. The changeling can sense when such an attack is being made and can enhance it with the Bite of the Wooden Fang clause as a reflexive action. Such enchantments last until the end of the scene or the end of this power, whichever comes first.',

            'Sorrow is the paradoxical torment: the suffering that eases suffering. In Arcadia, pain was a species: a hundred races of hurt, each devoted to its own method and taste. But Sorrow set itself apart from the simple animal pains of Burning, Cutting and their cousins, for it induced a special numbness: a fatalism that allowed contracted changelings to endure other discomfort. Sorrow is a pain of contemplation. Once the Lost accepts its inevitability, other hurts fade.',
            'In the Winter Court, the Sorrow-Frozen Heart is an unpopular Contract, but it is theirs nonetheless. Most Winter changelings prefer to master sorrow through calculated denial. They fight despondency with hope, but only apply it to attainable things. To live for today and revel in a quiet life is hardly spectacular, but serves cautious courtiers well enough. The minority who embrace the contract take the radical step of accepting their sadness, even reveling in it. She crosses that threshold and strikes a powerful, heart-wrenching bargain.',
            'As the Lost explores this Contract’s clauses, she inevitably loses her empathy for others. Practitioners become absorbed in the particulars of their own sorrow. How could anyone else’s pain compare to that which they’ve come to know so intimately? This is a power of the Sorrow-Frozen Heart. Its warriors do not flinch at inflicting pain. Compared to sorrow, anything else is like a snowflake compared to a glacier.',
            'The Sorrow-Frozen Heart is a subtle Contract, suited to the Court. It doesn’t cause any obviously supernatural displays. The Court desires quiet survivors who can protect Winter’s holdings even in extreme adversity. Practitioners treat it as a memoriam in action. They remember the sorrow of slavery and channel it into tools that will protect them from it ever after.',
            'This Contract’s nature makes it fundamentally incompatible with the ability to regain Willpower from fulfilling a Virtue. Inspiring moments disrupt the character’s sorrow. If the changeling satisfies a Virtue while using Contracts of the Sorrow-Frozen Heart, the player can refuse to refresh his character’s Willpower. (The character chooses to dwell within his sorrow instead of the moment of inspiration.) If he does not, the Contract’s benefits end immediately.'

From pledges and vows to Contracts, each can trace its roots back to some ancient pact between fae folk and the concepts, objects or entities of reality around them. These deals are witnessed and given power by the Wyrd, a mystic fae force without which Faerie and the Hedge would not exist. It makes sense then, that some of the oldest and most powerful of faerie magic is based upon bargains struck with the Wyrd itself. However, just as making bargains with the canny Gentry is dangerous business for the Lost, so is attempting to exert control over the wily and powerful Wyrd. Goblin Contracts of the Wyrd all have inherent drawbacks that come into play when a changeling attempts to activate them. And, while they are powerful and very useful, the Wyrd does not tolerate incompetence — each Wyrd Goblin Contract also has an unusually high penalty that must be paid if the changeling attempting to activate them dramatically fails to successfully do so. Still, when the cause is desperate enough, some Lost are willing to take their chances.',

            'The mechanics for detecting active Contracts are similar to those for detecting supernatural beings (p. 92, Changeling: The Lost.) At the player’s request, the Storyteller makes a secret roll using the Lost’s Clarity as the dice pool, with standard Perception modifiers applied. The Lost can detect one already activated, non-concealed Contract in the area per success. (Dramatic failures work per the standard Kenning rules.) This detection gives the Lost the general Contract type (Dream, Fleeting Spring or Goblin Sacrifice, for example) but does not reveal the specific clause activated unless the Lost possesses that clause themselves, or an Exceptional Success is rolled. The changeling may, however, make an Intelligence + Occult roll for each Contract sensed by Kenning. Upon a success, the Lost is able to determine the specific clause active. The ST may require more than one success for rare or unusual Contracts or clauses. This roll may be made for each specific Contract detected.',

Success indicates that the character is aware that another Lost is attempting to activate a Contract, but it does not automatically tell her what Contract is being attempted unless she achieves an Exceptional Success (even if she possesses the Contract and/or clause herself). Upon making an Exceptional Success, she may make an additional Intelligence + Occult roll (with standard Perception modifiers) to determine the specific clause being attempted, with the target number of successes required being determined by the Storyteller based on the Contract’s rarity.',

For every success achieved on her activation roll, she may manifest a single sensory aspect to her illusionary Mantle, up to the level of her normal Mantle rating. Courtless who use this clause to manifest a Mantle from scratch can create the illusion of one up to a level equal to half the successes they rolled on the activation, rounded up, although this number may never exceed 5 levels.',
            'At the end of the first scene, the changeling may choose to spend two points of Glamour to automatically activate the Contract for an additional scene. This must be paid for with Glamour (not a use of the catch). At the end of this second scene, she may pay three Glamour to continue the effect for a third scene, and so on, until she reaches the maximum amount of glamour she can spend during any one turn. This extension can be done for as long as the Lost chooses continues to spend the Glamour and is able to spend enough to meet the ever-growing cost. However, when the changeling ceases to spend the Glamour to extend the effect, the Drawback immediately manifests, and lasts for the entire time the Contract’s power was in effect (in days, hours and minutes, not number of scenes.)',

Although the changeling’s natural Mantle springs back in full force at the end of the scene, for a time period twice the length of the time period the illusory Mantle was in place, remnants of the false Mantle remain perceptible. A Winter Courtier who had suppressed her icicle-bedecked hair in favor of manifesting Spring blossoms for a three-hour scene, might find that, for the three hours after the scene ended, there were still fading rose-petals encased in her newly-returned frost, for example. For the Courtless, this manifestation results in a fading traces of her manifested Mantle enshrouding her. Too weak to be mistaken for a “real” Mantle, this after-effect is only strong enough to act as a clue to others that the Lost has been tinkering with strange magic.'

Likewise, very obscure creature, object or effect types (one of a kind fae items, creatures, or very rare Wyrdfocused spells, powers or emanations) might require more than a single success to identify clearly. Similarly, this power does not automatically give Lost in depth information about non-fae items or supernatural character types, other than their general appearance, demeanor or resonance, and that they are of a non-fae supernatural type.
