Eating the bulb is unpleasant, to say the least (it may require a Resolve + Composure roll to choke down the acidic, chewy sourness), but upon doing so a character’s very flesh begins turning to a drifting vapor. The body becomes all vapor and then, with a brief wind, is gone from the Hedge. The character reappears within a few miles of wherever the character entered the Thorns in the first place.

Above the Gourdbody is always a fat gourd, the Headgourd, that is often striated with patterns of green and orange. It even seems to have eyes and a puckered mouth. Cracking open the head offers a stinking, brain-like fruit that can be eaten (some liken it to foul French cheeses), but it has a separate function, as well. If a changeling smears the mess across his body, he becomes harder to hit (+1 to his Defense), as the odor forms a kind of pungent and invisible barrier around the character.

Consuming a single pear will rid the person of one disease of that person’s choice, anything from ringworm to bone cancer. (Derangements do not count.)

            "This “goblin fruit,” if it can be called as such, is actually a pale, sage-colored lichen. It’s soft to the touch and, when consumed, is said to provide a major kick to one’s potency and virility. Obtaining the Pedicle Velvet, however, isn’t that easy. Pedicle Velvet grows on the antlers and horns of various Hedge goblin-animals like on the Bloodfoam Elk or the Bristleram. Pedicle Velvet never grows on benevolent, meek animals — always on those beasts that seem to embody the kind of fierce virility promised by the consumption of this lichen. Eating the lichen raw (it tastes like sucking on a penny) provides a number of benefits. First, the lichen heals a single point of lethal damage. Second, the lichen provides a boost to one’s Stamina (+1 for the next six hours). Third, though this one’s somewhat unsubstantiated, the lichen guarantees that the character’s next sexual encounter will result in a pregnancy. Of course, said pregnancy may very well end in a miscarriage or abortion, but it’s a conception just the same. To gain the benefits, one must eat all the Pedicle Velvet upon a given beast. The lichen cannot be shared between several characters."
