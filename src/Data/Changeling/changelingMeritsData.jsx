This has little mechanical effect, though certainly it’s possible that a player will seek to affect stats accordingly as a character grows younger — Willpower might drop, for instance, but Physical stats might increase a bit.",

Maybe a year passes and the character appears a bit younger, but it’s only the type of thing that really shows itself over a long chronicle — and even then, it doesn’t have any huge systemic effect on the character, instead incurring a more narrative effect.

            "Effect: This Merit reflects how well liked and respected you are in a Court other than your own. While members of a given Court will always be true to their own members and agendas above all, they are more likely to give you the benefit of the doubt in a dispute, or come to your assistance if it does not undermine their own position. Unlike Mantle, which represents a supernatural quality as well as a political one, Court Goodwill is entirely a social construct, and depends entirely on the opinions of the members of that Court. Mistreat them, and Court Goodwill can disappear in a flash; cultivate their friendship, and they might rally to your defense when no one else will.",
            "Court Goodwill adds to dice pools for social interaction with members of the Court in question (though not supernatural powers based on Social rolls). Each two dots (rounding up) add a +1 die bonus to relevant rolls with members of that particular Court, so a changeling with Court Goodwill (Autumn) •• adds a +1 die bonus to Social rolls with a member of the Autumn Court. The Merit also allows one to learn some of that Court’s Contracts, though the highest levels are generally reserved for members alone. As with Mantle, loss of Court Goodwill does not prevent the changeling from using any Contracts that she no longer meet the prerequisites for, though she suffers the usual penalties (see p. 124). This Merit may be purchased multiple times, representing a character’s relationship with a different Court each time. A player cannot purchase Court Goodwill (Courtless); the Empty Hearts are not a social entity in their own right. Lastly, a character cannot purchase Court Goodwill with his own Court that is the province of the Mantle Merit.",
            "Because Court Goodwill is a purely social construction, a changeling may choose to ignore an attempt by another character to apply Court Goodwill to a roll they are involved in, essentially snubbing him despite his reputation in their Court. For example, if an Autumn changeling tried to apply Court Goodwill (Summer) •••• to a roll against member of the Summer Court, the target could declare that he was ignoring the character’s reputation and thus deny the Autumn changeling those two bonus dice. However, such disrespect is a serious insult. Unless the snubbing character can prove there was a valid reason to do so the outsider was throwing his weight around in a supremely petty fashion, for example, or trying to use his leverage to get the character to act against the best interests of the Court more often than not, the momentary satisfaction of the slight costs the character dearly within his own Court. It might even result in a reduction of his Mantle rating as his reputation as a member of that Court slips, not to mention earn him the ire of the Court whose member he snubbed.",
            "Different Seasons: When a changeling shifts from one Court to another, this transition is reflected in the appropriate Merits as well. First, the character’s Mantle rating in his old Court is halved, rounded down and becomes Court Goodwill to his old Court instead. By the same token, any Court Goodwill the changeling had with his new Court is halved, rounded down and becomes his new Mantle rating.",
            "Take the example of Jenny Iron, an Ogre of the Autumn Court who defects to the Summer Court. She previously had Mantle (Autumn) ••• and Court Goodwill (Summer) ••••; she’s been fighting for Summer causes more than the Autumn of late. Now that she’s a soldier of the Iron Spear, Jenny’s previous Mantle (Autumn) becomes Court Goodwill (Autumn) •, while her Court Goodwill (Summer) becomes Mantle (Summer) ••.",
            "It might seem a touch curious that changelings can retain any ties with their old Courts, but in truth most changelings are accustomed to such intrigues. Of course, if the shift is revealed to be true treachery of a more sinister sort, their Court Goodwill with their old friends will likely vanish in a hurry."

In addition, while a Devotee zealously throws himself into completing the changeling’s commands, sometimes they have... creative ways of interpreting instructions. A Lost asks one of his zealots, “While I’m busy across town going through Bethany’s closets, I need you to occupy her for the next few hours so she doesn’t come home.” The cultist does as demanded, but interprets “occupy her” as meaning “put her in the hospital.” Technically, it worked.

Once an opponent has been reduced to 0 Willpower, each successive strike at his mind with the No Mercy maneuver increases his dice penalty by 1. Using this tactic calls for a Clarity roll if the attacker’s Clarity is 7 or higher (roll three dice).",
            "In addition, opponents who end a Hedge Duel with more than a –2 penalty thanks to this punishment suffer from a mild derangement (or an upgrade of an existing derangement from mild to severe) for the next 24 hours. Those who end a Hedge Duel with a –5 or greater penalty or less Willpower suffer the derangement or upgrade for an entire week. When an opponent reaches a –10 penalty, he are no longer able to function and falls to the ground in a quivering, fetal ball. It is considered exceptionally poor form to kill an opponent who has been so incapacitated, even if the duel was announced as being to the death, so adroit Hedge Duelists will often attempt to pause their mind attacks just short of this threshold if they intend on killing their victim. (Killing a victim who is incapacitated in this manner calls for a degeneration roll if the attacker’s Clarity is 2 or higher. Roll two dice.)",
            "<b>Hedge Wrath (•••••):</b> The Hedge is not a nice place. The fact that it seems to cooperate more freely with changelings who come into its fickle environ for the purposes of harming each other is just one example of its cruel nature. For those who are able to harness this cruelty, however, the Thorns are an incredible weapon. With Hedge Wrath, your character is able to sacrifice her own Willpower to fan the Hedge’s lethal potential even higher. She may spend a Willpower point to enhance any Hedge Duel attack in which she is reshaping the Hedge to strike at her enemy; the usual benefits apply. In addition, if that attack is an exceptional success, all damage the attack does is aggravated, rather than lethal."

        "LongDescription": [
            "Your character has an innate connection to some very specific purview of Wyrd reality that emulates, to a lesser degree, the Others’ connections thereto. This allows her to craft pledges with that purview off the cuff, without the need for another individual to serve as a witness or agent of the Wyrd.",
            "For each dot your characters has in this Merit, she has a connection with one purview of the Wyrd. These purviews are very specific. “Animals” is too general a purview, as is “canines,” but “dogs,” “wolves,” “coyotes” or “jackals” are all appropriate purviews. Similarly, “nighttime” is too broad a purview, but “dusk,” “dawn,” “midnight” or “moonless nights” are all acceptable.",
            "A changeling with the Goblin Vow Merit can craft a pledge just as she would a one-sided pledge, choosing the task, boon and duration, which must equal out to a zero sum. (Note the missing sanction, which requires that the tasks are strong enough to equal out to both boon and duration. Thus, most Goblin Vows are very short in duration.) Elements of the pledge are all based on one of the particular purviews the character possesses, with the task serving that purview in some manner and the boon being some aspect of that purview the character can benefit from.",
            "<b>Purview Favors:</b> Similar to a traditional favor boon, the changeling in a Goblin Pledge asks a favor from the other entity in the pledge. However, unlike a traditional boon, the other party is not a mortal or changeling but a purview of the Wyrd itself. This allows a great deal of flexibility in the nature of the favor, but it must be in keeping with the purview itself. Purviews of fire, such as candles, fireplaces or bonfires, for example, might grant warmth, summon a small flame, illuminate an area or give protection from burning. Darkness purviews, such as various aspects of night, might hide one from attackers, grant restful sleep or even lull a bored enemy into dozing off. Midnight, however, could not grant one sharp claws or protection from hunters who are using scent, rather than sight.",
            "<b>Disadvantage:</b> Unlike normal pledges, Goblin Pledges contain their own innate sanctions, which are separate from the balancing equation of task, boon and duration. Goblin Pledge sanctions are activated by the Wyrd, should the pledger fail to follow through on her tasks after making the pledge, and are equal in severity to the task total + 1.",
            "<b>Example:</b> Annie Lida, a young Skitterskulk who has the Goblin Vow Merit •••• (Black Velvet, Cemeteries, Earthworms and Moonless Nights) finds herself being chased down a dead-end multi-story alley by an ill-intentioned gang of thugs. Exhausted and injured, her options are few. She can’t climb over the walls; they’re too tall. It’s too late to double-back out of the alley, and every Contract that she has that might help her requires the use of Glamour, which she is out of. She looks up and realizes that the night sky is clear and dark — the moon is new and invisible. Desperate, she crafts a Goblin Pledge: “Dark night, dark night, hide your daughter from their sight. If I live through the day, I will break every lit streetlight I see for the next month.” She expends a point of Willpower to invoke the pledge, and finds herself shrouded in nightdarkness. The thugs look for her, but can’t pick her out of the shadows and eventually leave the alley in search of easier prey.",
            "In this case, Annie’s pledge task (breaking every lit streetlight she sees for a month) is a medial endeavor (–2), the pledge’s duration is a day (+1) and the boon was fairly minor (+1). (Had she asked for the ability to harm the thugs, it might have been a medial task, or to kill them, a greater one.)",
            "Annie has no control over the sanction of the Goblin Vow. She leaves the alley, still shrouded in darkness, and for the next three weeks, is fastidious about shooting out every lit streetlight she sees with her pellet gun. However, just before the task is completed, she finds herself in the street as night is falling, and as the lights come on, she chooses to go out with some friends rather than spend the evening destroying streetlights. The Wyrd is evoked with the breaking of the pledge, and the Storyteller chooses a greater curse sanction (see p. 182 of Changeling: The Lost) for the next day (the duration of the pledge).",

Insects, fish and horses may be a bit more difficult to explain, while animals seen as dangerous (wolves, big cats or bears) or endangered (Tasmanian devils, lemurs or many birds of prey) may not only draw huge amounts of attention but the wrath of the human authorities as well. Likewise, horses and other “beasts of burden” as well as large animals of other sorts may be difficult for an urban changeling to house. Since the Hedge Beast is entering into the companion relationship predominantly for protection and sanctuary, boarding the creature away from the changeling, or having it remain within the Hedge for the majority of the time is dissatisfactory treatment. Changeling characters who lose their companions through neglect, abuse or disrespect, or those whose companions are killed receive no refund of their Merit points. Depending on the circumstances and whether the situation was their fault or simply bad fortune, characters may or may not have earned enough respect amongst other Hedge Beasts to encourage another to seek out their companionship.

(A character who wants a humble cabin doesn’t need to allocate much here, but a character who wants an elaborate treetop village stocked with delights should be ready to invest quite a bit.) A Hollow without any dots in Amenities contains few if any buildings or possessions — it might be big but it’s mostly empty space. At the other end of the spectrum, a retreat with five dots in amenities is likely fully stocked with all manner of luxuries, and while most of these Amenities are made of ephemeral dreamstuff and thus cannot travel across the Hedge or even that far from their origin within it, they still make for a very pleasing stay. (In other words, Hollow Amenities cannot be used as a substitute for other Merits such as Resources or Harvest, and if the character wants the things found in his Hollow to travel outside of it, he must purchase the appropriate Merits to represent these riches.) While a high Hollow Amenities rating often entails a high Hollow Size rating, exceptions do occur for example, a changeling might not invest much in Hollow Size, but then make that small cabin a veritable wonderland full of excellent food, interesting books and a magical fireplace that keeps itself at the perfect temperature all the time.

Without any dots in Hollow Doors, a Hollow is assumed to have one entrance in the real world and one small entrance in the Hedge — the Hollow can be reached through either side. (A character may waive either of these “free” entrances if he only wishes the Hollow to be accessible from one side.) With each dot in Hollow Doors, the Hollow has one additional point of entry/exit, either in the real world or through the Hedge. For example, with the expenditure of multiple dots, each motley member might have a door in his own residence that allows him access to the group’s private Hollow. Note that these doors must be tied to static access points in either realm — these places do not change.",
            "Of course, a changeling might have the most gigantic and elaborate Hollow imaginable, but unless it is properly warded and secured against intrusion, it will most likely be lost to opportunistic scavengers in short order — or worse yet, subject to an unpleasant visitation from the Others. Thus, it is wise to invest at least a few dots in Hollow Wards, representing the precautions both mundane and magical that protect the Hollow from unwanted visitors. Each dot invested in Hollow Wards subtracts one die from all attempts by unwanted visitors to find or break into the Hollow; in addition, those inside receive a +1 die bonus per dot on their Initiative compared to those attempting to break in. Lastly, the more dots invested in Hollow Wards, the less likely the location is to be found by True Fae or creatures from the Hedge; each dot subtracts one die from any rolls made to find the Hollow.",
            "Characters whose players spend no points at all on Hollow simply do not have access to any sort of special location in the Hedge. They might come as guests to another’s dwelling from time to time, but if they wish to have regular access to any particular location, they must purchase this Merit on their own or pool points with other changelings who already own an existing Hollow. Characters with no Hollow points simply do not enjoy the mechanical benefits of having spent dots on a better living space in the Hedge.",
            "Each aspect of the Hollow Merit has a limit of 5. In other words, Hollow Size, Hollow Amenities, Hollow Wards and Hollow Doors may not rise above 5 (to a maximum of 20 points spent on this Merit). The combined pool of points is used to determine the cost in experience points for raising the Hollow Merit during play.",
            "<b>Special:</b> The Hollow Merit may be shared among characters in a close-knit group. They might simply be a motley whose members are devoted to one another and are willing to pool what they have, or perhaps their mutual reliance on an individual or trust could bring them together to share what they have in common.",
            "To share this Merit, two or more characters simply have to be willing to pool their dots for greater capability. A shared rating in the Hollow Merit cannot rise higher than five dots in any of the four aspects of the trait. That is, characters cannot pool more than five points to be devoted to, say, Hollow Size. If they wish to devote extra points to the Merit, they must allocate those dots to a different aspect of the Merit, such as Wards or Doors.",
            "Shared Hollow dots can be lost. Motley members or associates might be abused or mistreated, ending relationships. Group members might perform actions that cast themselves (and the group) in a bad light. Ravaging creatures from the Hedge might damage part of the location, or some True Fae could discover the Hollow and decide to make it their personal residence for a time. If any group member does something to diminish the Hollow, its dots decrease for all group members. That’s the weakness of sharing dots in this Merit. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link. The Storyteller dictates when character actions or events in a story compromise shared Hollow dots.",
            "Characters can also leave a shared Hollow. A rift might form between close sworn comrades, or perhaps a character falls in battle. Or one could simply be kicked out of the Hollow by the others. When a character leaves a sharedHollow relationship, the dots he contributed are removed from the pool. If the individual still survives, he doesn’t get all his dots back for his own purposes. He gets one less than he originally contributed. So, if a character breaks a relationship with his motley, his two Hollow dots are lost by the group, but he gets only one dot back for his own purposes. The lost dot represents the cost or bad image that comes from the breakup. If all members agree to part ways, they all lose one dot from what they originally contributed.",
            "The Storyteller decides what reduced dots mean in the story when a character leaves a shared Hollow. Perhaps no one else picks up the character’s attention to the Hollow’s mystical defenses, causing Hollow Wards to drop. The Hollow might not be tended as fastidiously, causing a drop in the Hollow Amenities value. Maybe a portion of the Hollow falls into disuse or even collapses, causing an effective drop in Hollow Size. Whatever the case, a plausible explanation must be determined.",
            "A character need not devote all of her Hollow dots to the shared Hollow Merit, of course. A changeling might maintain a separate Hollow of her own outside the communal one represented by the shared trait. Any leftover dots that a character has (or is unwilling to share) signify what she has to draw upon as an individual, separate from her partners. For example, three characters share a Hollow and expend a group total of five dots. One character chooses to use two other dots on a private Hollow for herself. Those remaining two dots represent a Hollow entirely separate from what she and her friends have established together.",
            "To record a shared Hollow Merit on your character sheet, put an asterisk next to the name of the Hollow Merit and fill in the total dots that your character has access to thanks to his partnership. In order to record his original contribution, write it in parentheses along with the Merit’s name. It is not important to note which aspect of the Hollow Merit on which those points are spent, as this allows greater flexibility should a character ever decide to withdraw from the community arrangement.",
            "In this example, the character shares a Hollow Merit dedicated to the motley’s communal refuge. He contributes two dots to the relationship, and the group has a total of four dots that are made available to each member. The character also has his own private Hollow Merit rated •••, which he maintains by himself. And, the character has Ally rated •• that is also his own Merit."

The higher a changeling’s Mantle rating, the more he has come to embody that Court’s ideal — even if he is a hermit who doesn’t involve himself in local politics, a character with a high Mantle is still given at least grudging respect by his peers because of his obvious commitment to the values his Court cherishes. From a descriptive perspective, as a character’s Mantle rises, his fae mien reflects this ascendance, displaying both literal and figurative signs of the season. A character with Mantle (Autumn) • might be followed by a slight brisk breeze, for example, while one with Mantle (Autumn) ••• might have illusory leaves kicked up as she walks and at last at Mantle (Autumn) •••••, the character might be illuminated by late afternoon light and surrounded by a reflective hush similar to that found in a library. Specific examples of how a Court’s particular Mantle increases can be found in the “Courts” section in Chapter One. These trappings are not visible to mortals and have no real game effect, but should be used to enhance a character’s description and convey a sense of how rooted in her Court she has become.",
            "As a sign of brotherhood, Mantle adds to dice pools for social interaction with members of the Court in question. Each dot adds a +1 die bonus to relevant rolls with members of that particular Court. This Merit does not add to dice pools predicated on supernatural powers. Characters with no Court cannot purchase Mantle. Mantle also serves as a prerequisite for learning certain Court-related Contracts.",
            "A character may learn clauses from the relevant Contract path of his Court, which generally require a certain amount of Mantle to learn, though he must still meet any other prerequisites as well. Should his Mantle fall or he adopt the Mantle of a new Court, he might no longer meet the prerequisites for some of his old Contracts; in that case, he must spend additional Glamour to activate those Contracts. (See “Changing Seasons,” p. 94, and the note on Contract prerequisites, p. 174).",
            "Each Court has certain mechanical and descriptive benefits for all its members developing a Mantle rating, as outlined in the Court descriptions in Chapter One. In addition to those benefits, each Court has a benefit reserved for its leader, an advantage most commonly referred to its “crown.” A crown can only manifest in a freehold where there are at least a handful of members of a particular Court and they are able to choose a common leader, and generally manifests only during the appropriate physical season. Occasionally, a crown will manifest during the off-season if a Court is especially prominent or powerful in the area, as the Hedge reflects the Court’s potency, or a changeling who is elected leader of the freehold might manifest his crown out of season if he is sufficiently popular. Note that the leader of a Court is not always the member with a highest Mantle rating. Ultimately, the Storyteller is the final arbiter of when and how a crown appears, but as a rule, only one crown may manifest in a given freehold at a time.",
            "<b>Blessing of the Green (Spring):</b> A character who wears the crown of Spring may spend a Willpower point to bestow the Blessing of the Green, allowing her to add her Mantle rating as bonus successes to a single roll related to gathering Glamour. The changeling may use this ability up to a maximum number of times per session equal to her Mantle dots. A particular character may only benefit from one use of this ability per session, however. The Spring fae may cast this blessing on herself, or she may choose to bestow it on another with a touch, in which case the blessing must be used before the next sunrise or it is lost.",
            "<b>Challenge of the Black Spear (Summer):</b> This benefit applies in one-on-one situations such as duels. By spending a Glamour point, the character with the crown of Summer receives a bonus to his Initiative rating equal to his Mantle dots for the duration of the duel, and is not considered surprised by ambushes or other unexpected trickery, though if the duel shifts to mass combat this Initiative bonus drops to a simple +1. The changeling may use this ability multiple times per session, up to a maximum number equal to his Mantle rating. However, this ability may only be used once against a particular foe per combat.",
            "<b>Harvest of Whispers (Autumn):</b> Once per session, the Autumn leader may take a minute to reflect on what she has learned so far that session (and consult the Storyteller as to whether or not a particular bit of information qualifies for this ability), and then perform the Harvest of Whispers. For each valuable secret, important truth, revelatory fact or other significant piece of information she has uncovered this session, up to a maximum number equal to her Mantle rating, the character receives two Glamour points that are placed in a special pool apart from her regular Glamour points. These harvested Glamour points can be spent only to power Contracts, activate tokens, facilitate dream travel or cross into the Hedge. These points cannot be used for any other purposes, including seeming abilities, and cannot in any way traded or given away; anything left in this pool fades to nothingness at the end of the session. This ability may allow the character to effectively exceed the limit of Glamour points she can possess as dictated by her Wyrd, but the number of Glamour points she can spend per turn is still limited normally. Furthermore, as long as a character exceeds her normal limit of Glamour, she is considered especially noticeable by beings that can detect Glamour or magical energy, so unless she wishes to attract undue attention, it is also best to ready a concealing Contract or two to help dim this radiance.",
            "It is important to note that only new information learned that session can be used for the Harvest of Whispers even if a character learned something just last session, it’s old news and doesn’t qualify. Those who don the crown of the Autumn Court are expected to always be seeking out new and interesting information, not rest on the body of knowledge they’ve already accumulated. The Storyteller is the final arbiter of whether a piece of information is new, valuable or important enough to qualify for this ability.",
            "<b>Feast of Ashes (Winter):</b> Once per session, a changeling wearing the crown of the Winter Court may devote himself to the Feast of Ashes, converting one point of Glamour to one point of Willpower, up to a maximum number of points equal to the character’s Mantle rating. He may even exceed his normal limit of Willpower points in this fashion, though any excess points are lost at the end of the session. In addition, for the remainder of the scene in which this ability is activated, the changeling’s Willpower rating is effectively increased by a number equal to his Mantle rating, making it extremely hard for others to undermine his confidence in his ability to survive."

This chain always manifests in some way in the creature’s appearance: iron collars around the neck and silver cords about the wrist are typical markers, but brands, tattoos and even fur patterns have been known to manifest. So long as the slave’s fetters remain, it must make a successful Resolve + Composure roll to act against its master. The roll is penalized by -3 dice if the slave attempts to refuse, ignore or disobey a direct order, and -5 if it tries to physically harm the character. Even the most simple- minded slaves have feelings, however, and the Storyteller can reduce (or even waive) these penalties in the face of long-term abuse.",

At •, the slave is little more than a magical automaton, such as a lamp that follows its master or a broom that sweeps of its own ac- cord. For ••, the slave is a simple imp or wisp of limited intelligence, capable of carrying out relatively simple tasks but without any significant capacity for problem solving. At •••, the slave has the intelligence (and often temperament) of a child. At this value, a slave can be large enough to provide its master with physical defense and may possess one dot in a single Contract. A •••• slave is a familiar of average intellect and skill, perhaps possessing two dots in a single Contract. Finally, for •••••, the slave is of greater-than-average intelligence or strength, able to think critically and creatively about problems and possessed of four clauses from one or two Contracts. At this level, the slave may even be a changeling or non-fae supernatural creature (with four of their appropriate powers), but keeping such powerful creatures as slaves is asking for trouble.",

Some changelings, however, learn the ability to create tokens themselves, a useful skill that often puts them in great demand by their peers (and by the True Fae who would prefer such craftsmen remained in their own “employ”).",
            "Creating a token is a long and arduous project that requires not only great skill but a commitment of personal energies as well. First, the character must be able to accurately create some sort of plans, recipe or blueprint for the creation. Creating a recipe from scratch is an extended Intelligence + Occult roll, with one day required per roll and total successes required of five per dot in the token. This research cannot be interrupted until complete, or all successes are lost. In some cases, the crafter may be able to discover a plan that some other changeling has created, and work directly from that. Such a discovery may be the focus of a story — and may result in an object with unforeseen quirks reflecting the unknown author.",
            "Tokens are created as an extended action (Wyrd + Crafts) with each roll representing two weeks of work and a target number of 25 per dot of Token. Thus a twodot token such as a Lantern of Ill Omen would require 50 successes to create. Token Makers must expend at least one point of Glamour per two weeks into their work, and may expend up to five per month. Each point of Glamour above the first counts as an automatic success toward the total. The character must work for at least eight hours each day; working 16 or more hours a day adds an additional two dice to the roll per week that the character can maintain this schedule. If the crafter leaves off in the middle of her project, accumulated successes remain — but if she fails to pick up her tools again and resume work within two weeks, the successes are lost as the Glamour flees and her inspiration leaves her.",
            "Changelings possessing the Workshop Merit below may additionally halve the time per roll (if working on a token made of a material which falls within one of their Workshop’s Specialty areas) should any points in Workshop focus on that specialty.",
            "<i>Example: Annie Bumble wants to create a Curious Paw Token (p. 207 of Changeling: The Lost). She’s a passable taxidermist and has a nicely appointed taxidermy table set up in her Hollow (one dot in Workshop: Taxidermy). She sequesters herself in her Hollow to work on it. Because she has a dot in Taxidermy allocated to her Workshop Hollow, she halves two weeks, making her time per roll one week. At the end of the first week of work, she spends one Glamour for the required investment and five more toward automatic successes. Her player rolls Annie’s Wyrd (3) + Crafts (4) + Crafts Specialty: Taxidermy (1) + Workshop (Taxidermy) (3) and gets 4 successes on the 11 dice. Adding in her automatic successes, Annie has now accumulated nine successes toward the 100 required to complete the Curious Paw. At the end of the next week of work, she spends another Glamour (with the option of spending up to five more) and makes another roll, accumulating the successes until she has reached 100 and the Curious Paw is complete.</i>",
            "<b>Drawbacks:</b> Token drawbacks are not within the control of their creator. They are a result of the cagey nature of Glamour, and cannot be guided by the token’s maker’s hand or will. As tokens are forged in part out of the maker’s own Glamour, however, the drawback often reflects a connection to the maker in some way. One Darkling craftsman’s token might cause temporary blindness after being used, while another item by the same artisan might attract spiders to the user’s home. For already published tokens, such as those found on pp. 202–209 of Changeling: The Lost or in Chapter Four of this book, Storytellers have the option of using the listed drawback or creating one that more closely ties the token to its creator’s nature."

A knife hung at her belt or a bed she sleeps on at night counts: the coffee maker she uses every morning would not count. At the culmination of that time period, the Storyteller rolls a single die — if that die is a success (8 or above on the roll), the object becomes a token as her Wyrd has inadvertently infused it.

Your character has a true love — she need not be a changeling or love the character in return but must be something capable of sharing the love — and his need for her is so desperate that it has been imprinted on fate. When working to protect or save his love, the character gains a single automatic success when spending Willpower on a roll rather than the usual three dice bonus. Furthermore he regains one spent point of Willpower in any scene in which he directly protects her from danger.",
            "<b>Drawback:</b> Unfortunately, the character’s true love gets the bad end of the deal. She is often in danger, regularly targeted by the denizens of the World of Darkness, perhaps because the character cares about her, perhaps for some other ineffable reason. When the love is in trouble, the character suffers a –2 distraction penalty to all actions that don’t directly relate to saving her. If the love ever dies, the character loses the Merit."
