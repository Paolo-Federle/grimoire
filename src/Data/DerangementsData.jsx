Those who suffer from the Abyssal Compulsion derangement, however, have sustained especially deep psychic wounds from their unfortunate experiences. The Abysscreates a terrible wound in the soul — unique to the Awakened state — that causes a mage to obsess upon the Void and its creatures, and to seek out the lore of such. Alternately, the willworker desires to do so to protect himself, to lock the knowledge away, or to pursue it further, with no rhyme or reason from one moment to the next.",

Willpower may not be spent to augment this roll, though the willworker may use indirect means of researching such knowledge (like scrying or sending ghosts or spirits, for instance), should he have such at his disposal. When acting as a Bedlam derangement, Abyssal Compulsion also adds one die to all Paradox rolls that the mage is required to make, as his attraction to the Void calls out to it and its creatures.",

            "Only Kindred who have succumbed to torpor (voluntarily or involuntarily) can have this derangement. Emerging from the deepest slumber, Kindred awaken with a varying degree of hesitance and fear of return trips to torpor. Those who have this derangement possess a completely defeatist attitude regarding their possible return to torpor. Not only do they accept the eventuality of their return, but they expect it to happen at any time. When presented with a situation that threatens such a state, the Kindred finds it difficult to resist or fight back. Similarly, he finds little cause to emerge from torpor when an outside stimulus begins to awaken him. If a vampire is confronted with a situation that could result in entering or emerging from torpor, apply a -3 penalty on any rolls to resist or confront that stimulus. This translates into having difficulty feeding when he is starving, rolls to awaken from torpor, and even participating in a particularly lethal fight. In the event of possibly lethal combat, the vampire does not suffer this penalty until he has taken more points of lethal damage than he has Willpower dots. A similar -3 penalty is applied to rolls made for feeding when the vampire is hungry (when he has no more than four Vitae in his system). Finally, periodic Resolve + Composure rolls may need to be made as the vampire resists urges to prepare his associates, holdings and himself for his eventual return to torpor.",

Not actually seeing a wild animal isn’t enough to trigger the mild effect of this derangement; if the character can see a patch of ground or sky where animals would be able to reach her, should she call for them, that’s usually enough to ward off anxiety. GM discretion should dictate what environments are problematic for the character.",

It’s not enough to simply see sky or ground, at this level of derangement – the character cannot function unless she knows that some form of animal life can hear her. If the player fails the Resolve + Composure roll to overcome the character’s anxiety, the character must spend one Vitae and activate the Call of the Wild power (Animalism •••), just to get a sense of how well she can be heard by nearby animals. If the dice pool to activate the power is penalized by the Storyteller due to the nature of the physical environment (sealed windows, secure foundations, etc.), that same penalty affects all the character’s dice pools for the scene if she fails to summon any animals (or if the summoned animals fail to reach her).",

OCD sufferers have a hard time reaching a sense of “completeness” in tasks, and so tend to repeat particular tasks until that sense of completeness finally comes to them. This affliction may manifest in overly repeated hand-washing, specific daily rituals (such as touching everything in a room upon arriving in it), tracing lines of wood grain, compulsive counting in doorways and similar activities. OCD is related to a few other mental disorders and in humans can often be kept under control with anti-depressive medication.",

Most of those theories relate to inbreeding among the tribe and with select groups of wolf-blooded kin. But this behavior happens among most tribes, Pure and Forsaken, and even if the Ivory Claws are more particular about their mates, this cannot be the whole explanation. More frequently, other Uratha suggest that Ivory Claws are more susceptible to this particular derangement because of the tribal obsession with purity. Others believe that the effect is part of Father Wolf’s death curse or the Moon’s subsequent interference in their great crusade.",

If the character has to trace every line of grain on the hardwood floor before he can sleep a night in a new room, or count to 1000 before leaving any room, that is probably a Severe derangement.",

In effect, the character “turns off” higher thought and regresses into an automatic state of task completion. A character under the influence of rote-action repetition might cease to pay attention to a discussion and instead count grains of salt or cubes of sugar. He might stack boxes and ignore someone trying to threaten him. He might sweep an immaculate foyer instead of dealing with the raging fire behind him, or he might simply perform mental arithmetic instead of facing the sorcerer menacing his throng.",

Such characters suffer a –2 penalty to all dice pools while the stressful situation persists, with the exception of dice pools related to their rote-action repetition.

            "Only Kindred can suffer from this special derangement. This delusion grows out of a vampire’s fundamental awareness of guilt about feeding on mortals. Kindred with this delusion believe they take part of victims’ minds or souls along with their blood. For hours after feeding, the Kindred hears a victim’s voice in his head, berating him, begging for mercy or making demands. The vampire even experiences ersatz memories from his victim’s life, all concocted by the vampire’s unconscious mind, but seeming very real. Weak-willed or especially guilt-stricken Kindred might even carry out actions on behalf of their victims. Whenever a sanguinary animist feeds on a mortal, the player makes an Intelligence + Composure roll. If the roll succeeds, the imaginary voice and memories of the victim torment the character for the rest of the night, but the character can function adequately. If the roll fails, the images in the character’s mind are so strong that the other personality can influence the vampire’s actions. The angry victim-personality usually means to harm the character, but the vampire might silence the victim’s voice by doing something he imagines the victim would like. If the player cannot roleplay the possessing victim’s personality, control of the character can pass to the Storyteller for short times. Control automatically reverts to the vampire just before dawn.",

A dramatic failure means that the ersatz personality of the victim becomes a permanent fixture in the vampire’s mind. Under stress, the victim’s voice becomes more insistent. The Kindred might distractedly respond aloud to the voices in his head. Further shocks could drive the vampire into multiple-personality disorder, with the Kindred taking on the fantasized personalities of victims.

As a mode of communication, the Tongue does not, of course, have a specific vocabulary or grammar all its own. In fact, the Tongue is the very essence of that which opposes rational thought in a linguistic sense, and as such, always comes out as gibberish when vocalized. A vampire with this derangement cannot, therefore, use the Tongue as a means of two-tiered communication, whereby he speaks to another Forsworn in an existing language but is actually transmitting an entirely different message. If a vampire uses a language with structure and syntax, with elements familiar to not only the Man but to other minds not of the Brood, then the vampire cannot use the Tongue simultaneously; his mind simply can’t process doing both at once. If he speaks nonsensically, however — even if his speech uses pieces of existing languages or vocabularies — then the Tongue will convey his true meaning when he is speaking to another Forsworn, so long as could make sense of it.",
            "The upside to the Tongue’s lack of structure is that its meaning and intent can be derived through writing as well as speech, so long as the text conforms to the same restrictions as vocalization. If a Forsworn vampire writes a note to a covey-mate in clear, articulated English, then the message implicit in the text is all that will be conveyed. If, however, he pens the same note using a series of meaningless pictograms, then another Forsworn (who also knows the Tongue) can derive the vampire’s general intent simply by scanning said pictograms. It’s important to note that the Tongue is a primal mode of communication, and thus is ill-suited to longwinded or detail-heavy expressions. If one wishes to convey truly involved or complex ideas, one should probably just speak or write normally.",

After one has abandoned the Pursuit in this fashion, the Tongue slowly recedes from one’s mind and soul, removing all trace of the Tongue’s passing as it goes.

        "LongDescription": [
            "Your character has decided that his spiritual or supernatural beliefs are so important than everyone should share them. He proselytizes to everyone he meets, given only a few minutes of conversation. He might ask people if they have accepted Jesus Christ as their personal savior, or he might simply warn people engaging in “sinful” behavior that they are bound for Hell. He might snap pictures of agents of the government conspiracy and warn other people to “stay away from <i>them</i>.” He might occasionally curse while looking at sky, as though expecting the aliens to arrive any moment. The game system for this derangement works similar to Supernatural Fascination, but the effects are more extreme, as described."
