            'A motley must have at least three members to construct a Bastion. Like a shared Hollow, a Bastion is created through experience point expenditure by the troupe as a whole rather than a single individual. The general shape and look of the Bastion can be decided by the motley as a whole, but the details depend on the changeling with the highest Wyrd rating. A Bastion is psychoactive in the same way as the Hedge and adapts itself to the highest Wyrd present. A changeling of the Autumn Court might cause the Bastion to decorate itself in gold, red and brown of fallen leaves, and the walls take on the look of burnt wood. Bastions are created by dreamscaping the shared dream of the motley (see Changeling: the Lost, p. 195). This creation process is an extended action instead of a contested action and is performed as a Teamwork action with a target number of 20. Each roll of the extended action represents one full night of work. Once constructed, the Bastion is a permanent addition to the dreams of the motley, even dreams they don’t share with each other. No matter what the dream is about, the Bastion will always appear in some way, either as a prominent feature or just a misty image in the distance.',
            'Mechanically, a Bastion is built in basically the same way as a Hollow and the maximum rating of any single feature is 5 dots. Bastion Size and Amenities both follow the same rules as those presented for Hollows (see Changeling: the Lost, p. 94). Unlike a Hollow, Bastions only have one external door, which acts more as a useful point of reference than an actual portal in and out of the Bastion. Only members of the motley that created the Bastion may enter it (peacefully anyways) and they may do so simply by picturing themselves inside as an instant action. Once inside, a changeling may not leave the Bastion until the dream has ended.',
            'In place of Wards, Bastions have Battlements. Each dot of Battlements is worth 10 points of damage that a besieger must overcome to win entrance. Only environmental attacks (see Changeling: the Lost, p. 198) have any effect on Battlements. Once a single dot of Battlements is reduced to zero, the dot rating of the Bastion Battlements is reduced by one.',
            'Repairs can be made to the Battlements either instantly with experience point expenditure (new dots x2), which represents the changeling putting a bit of herself into the Bastion or through the same sort of extended action Teamwork roll that created the Bastion in the first place. Repairing a single dot of Battlements requires 10 successes and each roll is equal to one night.',
            'In addition to increased protection, each dot in Battlements past the first allows more changelings the opportunity to strike back at their attacker from arrow slits or other similar defensive positions. Only Personal Attacks that take the form of ranged weapons may be used from the Battlements.',

Wherever it is, your character can transform into his animal aspect without drawing undue attention, then run or fly away with some measure of freedom.",

It’s probably covered in evidence of that nature, too — hair, scratch-marks, possibly droppings or urine marks to identify the place as “MINE!” Even so, the Den is remote enough to escape easy detection, even if it’s in the middle of a city. Hunters trying to track a character home will suffer a -2 penalty to the relevant tracking or investigation rolls. Still, the signs are there, and if you’re not careful, the secret might not last."

        "LongDescription": [
            "Prominently figuring in the death-legends of many cultures are caves, tunnels, cisterns, and doorways that lead into the depths of the Great Below. Sin-Eaters know all too well that such places contain the residue of darkness, stillness, and cold that comes with exposure to death. The lingering remnants of ghostly passage, or the association with death and the dead, can give some places a very real connection to the Underworld in truth. The Mayan term for such a place is a cenote, which refers to an underground cavern with a black pool that leads to the Underworld beneath its frigid, accepting waters. Experienced Sin-Eaters know, however, that these passages to the Great Below can and do occur in all manner of silent places; in addition to the usual suspects, cenotes can form in closets, basements, underground storage chambers, crawlspaces, or even in the industrial depths of an abandoned factory floor with labyrinthine passages amid the sunken machinery. More generally, the Bound refer to these places as low places, Avernian Gates. Those that have been claimed by a krewe or a Sin-Eater, though, are called Haunts. Sin-Eaters who have special access to a Haunt can rely on the power of the place to fuel their plasmic needs while also using the cenote as a soft point to cross into the Underworld.",
            "Haunts come in wide and moribund variety. One might be a tiny room with a secret hatch, barely large enough to fit a person, home to a child who became trapped and died down there; another could be a haunted manor that has a grisly subterranean chapel devoted to some Slavic death-god. The utility of a Haunt lies not in its size nor in its opulence, but rather in the power of its connection to the Great Below and in its ease of use. To this end, each cenote has a rating in three different factors: its utility, its fluidity, and its residue. Each factor provides a benefit to the Sin-Eater who has access to the Haunt in question. Each factor is also considered a separate Merit to purchase, with each Haunt having ratings in both categories, although a Sin-Eater need not necessarily purchase scores in both categories immediately.",
            "A Haunt is a useful tool, but it has a strong drawback. Sin-Eaters who sleep in cenotes find themselves haunted by ghostly visions and hideous dreams of death, much like the nightmares that afflict users of memorabilia mementos (see page 209). Sleeping at the heart of a Haunt prevents a Sin-Eater from regaining Willpower due to a night’s rest, as the rest in such a place is far from refreshing.",
            "A Haunt’s utility represents just how much use it can serve apart from its supernatural focus. It generally accords to the size, accessibility, general security, and helpful mundane accouterments that the location has to offer. A cenote with no dots in Haunt Utility might be a small sub-basement that the krewe can access but does not own, unable to provide any benefits beyond its supernatural power. Three dots in Haunt Utility could represent a solid but slightly decrepit haunted house, not legally owned by the krewe but generally unwanted by others. Five dots might represent a small museum complete with library or a plantation house in the swamp, able to provide room and board for an entire krewe, or host a magnificent Flesh Fair.",
            "A cenote’s fluidity represents the strength of its connection to the Underworld. Every Haunt is potentially an Avernian Gate to the Great Below, but some have a particular affinity for such travel. The more that a cenote follows mythic archetypes — containing a limpid pool of black water, an archway, a piece of funerary statuary — the stronger its connection tends to grow. For this reason, Sin-Eaters often decorate Haunts with such morbid representations. Each dot of Haunt Fluidity grants a +1 bonus to all attempts to cross into (or out of) the Underworld at its location, and an additional die toward any ceremonies performed within its boundaries. Note that this bonus is only useful to the Sin-Eater who possesses the appropriate dots; perhaps the Sin-Eater performs tiny rituals there to make a connection with the cenote, or owns several of the pieces of decorative artwork that create the funereal motif. This bonus does stack with the benefit granted by using mementos while crossing into the Underworld (see page 265).",
            "Finally, Haunt Residue provides a Sin-Eater with access to additional plasm. While a Sin-Eater can  gain plasm by dealing with ghosts or, in desperation, murder (see page 82), cenotes tend to leak ectoplasm into the material world. Ectoplasm that forms at a Haunt almost always does so at night, usually near the “witching hour” (midnight), and generally takes the form of a sticky or slimy residue, clear or yellowish, with a tendency to give off wavering vapors. A Sin-Eater can inhale these vapors to refuel her stores of plasm. Left by itself, plasm quickly dissipates, but powerful cenotes will continue to generate new residue. Each dot of Haunt Residue indicates one point of plasm that the cenote generates each week.",
            "Each cenote has separate ratings in Utility, Fluidity, and Residue. Further, a Sin-Eater may well have knowledge of multiple Haunts; in such a case, each cenote’s set of Merits is purchased and tracked separately.",
            "Special: A krewe of Sin-Eaters may share a Haunt, and indeed many krewes rely on cenotes as meeting places, locations to stash letters for the rest of the krewe, and centers for the performance of great ceremonies. The krewe may keep a Haunt’s location hidden from other Bound, or they may choose to flaunt their power by hosting Flesh Fairs there.",
            "When a krewe purchases a Haunt Merit communally, each Sin-Eater adds his or her dots in the appropriate Merits — Haunt Accessibility, Haunt Fluidity, and Haunt Residue — to the total value of the cenote. The entire krewe then benefits from the improved value of these Merits. For instance, a pair of Sin-Eaters could each donate one dot in each Haunt Merit, thereby granting their krewe a cenote with effectively two dots in each of Haunt Accessibility, Fluidity, and Residue. A shared Haunt like this is usable by anyone who has placed dots into the cenote’s purchase, as well as anyone who is part of a ceremonially-bound krewe with such a purchaser. Of course, this means that some krewes will have shiftless layabouts who contribute little to the upkeep of a cenote’s usefulness — which is a source of strife in more than one krewe.",
            "Should a krewe expel a member from its ranks, all of that member’s shared dots contributed to the Haunt are lost by the krewe; the discord of their ceremonial bond disrupts the flow of energies temporarily. The expelled Sin-Eater retains the Merit dots for his own use, perhaps representing a back-up location discovered or a new place to set up shop, but each Haunt Merit has its rating reduced by one dot. (If the Sin-Eater only contributed one dot in the first place, then that dot is lost.) In the event that a krewe breaks up and each member goes their separate ways, all of the dots of the shared Haunt are refunded to their previous contributors, less one dot each as a result of the breakup, need to find new locations, cost of moving personal effects, hurdles of gaining new access, and so on. Should a Sin-Eater die, all of her contributed dots vanish from the shared Merits of her krewe.",
            "Shared Haunts do not rise in value above ••••• in any category, even if the krewe contributes more total dots; excess dots are superfluous, but might prevent the cenote from losing potency if the krewe suffers a sudden loss.",
            "A Sin-Eater may also have personal access to a private cenote while contributing to the krewe’s shared Haunt. In such a case, the character simply possesses multiple versions of each Merit. The shared Haunt Utility for the group’s cenote, for instance, would be tracked and purchased separately from the Sin-Eaters own personal Haunt."

            "A haven is a place where a vampire sleeps, protected from the sun during the deadly daylight hours. Legends tell of vampires in dark, twisted citadels on high mountain peaks, complete with labyrinthine catacombs, but the reality is far less grandiose. In truth, a haven can be as simple as a sewer or an abandoned warehouse or a crate in a forgotten storage closet, as long as it is undisturbed between dawn and dusk.",
            "All havens are not created equal. A warehouse might have plenty of space and proximity to a significant amount of prey, but it might not be secure against unwanted visitors. An abandoned subway car in a long-forgotten tunnel has space and adequate security, but it might be so far out of the way that finding prey is difficult. Great time and effort is spent finding suitable havens, and their value is represented by three factors — location, size and security. Players who choose this Merit must also choose how to allocate these three factors when spending points. For instance, two points may be spent on Haven Location, with a third spent on Haven Security.",
            "A good Haven Location makes it easier for a vampire to feed, situated near a meeting place for large numbers of humans. A haven with many dots in this category might be close to several nightclubs or bars that do considerable nighttime business, while one with few dots might simply be close to a bus or train station that brings travelers on a regular basis. Each dot of Haven Location grants a +1 die bonus on hunting checks for the character who controls it and any whom she allows in. Havens without any dots in Location are sufficiently secluded so as to not provide any bonus.",
            "Haven Size is important to characters who need a place to safely store their possessions and valuables. A haven with no dots in Haven Size is just large enough for its owner and perhaps a single companion, with minimal if any storage capacity — the aforementioned crate in the forgotten storage closet, or a cramped apartment. By spending points to increase a haven’s size, a player allows for accoutrements and personal effects. Larger havens can be anything from mansions to mountain hideaways to vast subterranean catacombs. Note, however, that havens of considerable size are not necessarily easy to maintain.",

Players of characters who wish to ensure privacy and safety may choose to spend points on Haven Security, thus making it difficult for others to gain entrance. Havens with no dots in Haven Security can be found by those intent enough to look, and offer little protection once they have been breached. Each dot of Haven Security subtracts one die from efforts to intrude into the haven by anyone a character doesn’t specifically allow in. This increased difficulty may be because the entrance is so difficult to locate (behind a bookcase, under a carpet) or simply difficult to penetrate (behind a vault door). Also, each dot of Haven Security offers a +1 bonus on Initiative for those inside against anyone attempting to gain entrance (good sight lines, video surveillance).",
            "Characters whose players spend no points at all on Haven might have their own small, humble havens, or perhaps they share the haven of a sire or Prince. In any event, they simply do not gain the mechanical benefits of those who have spent Merit points improving the quality of their homes.",

They might simply be devoted to one another and willing to pool what they have, or perhaps their mutual reliance on an individual or trust could bring them together to share what they have in common.",
            "To share this Merit, two or more characters simply have to be willing to pool their dots for greater capability. A shared rating in the Haven Merit cannot rise higher than five dots in any of the three aspects of the trait. That is, characters cannot pool more than five points to be devoted to, say, Haven Size. If they wish to devote extra points to the Merit, they must allocate those dots to a different aspect of the Merit, such as Location or Security.",
            "Shared Haven dots can be lost. Coterie members or associates might be abused or mistreated, ending relationships. Group members might perform actions that cast themselves (and the group) in a bad light. Money might be spent or lost. If any group member does something to diminish the haven, its dots decrease for all group members. That’s the weakness of sharing dots in this Merit. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link. The Storyteller dictates when character actions or events in a story compromise shared Haven dots.",
            "Characters can also leave a shared haven. A rift might form between close Kindred. A character might meet Final Death. Or one could be kicked out of the haven by the others. When a character leaves a shared-Haven relationship, the dots he contributed are removed from the pool. If the individual still survives, he doesn’t get all his dots back for his own purposes. He gets one less than he originally contributed. So, if a character breaks a relationship with his coterie, his two Haven dots are lost by the group, but he gets only one dot back for his own purposes. The lost dot represents the cost or bad image that comes from the breakup. If all members agree to part ways, they all lose one dot from what they originally contributed.",
            "The Storyteller decides what reduced dots mean in the story when a character leaves a shared haven. Perhaps no one else picks up the character’s attention to Haven Security, leaving that to drop. The haven might not be tended as fastidiously, causing a drop in the Haven Location value. Maybe a portion of the haven falls into disuse or even collapses, causing an effective drop in Haven Size. Whatever the case, a plausible explanation must be determined.",
            "A character need not devote all of her Haven dots to the shared Haven Merit, of course. A Kindred might maintain a separate haven of her own outside the communal one represented by the shared trait. Any leftover dots that a character has (or is unwilling to share) signify what she has to draw upon as an individual, separate from her partners. For example, three characters share a haven and expend a group total of five dots. One character chooses to use two other dots on a private haven for herself. Those remaining two dots represent a haven entirely separate from what she and her partners have established together.",
            "To record a shared Haven Merit on your character sheet, put an asterisk next to the name of the Haven Merit and fill in the total dots that your character has access to thanks to his partnership. In order to record his original contribution, write it in parentheses along with the Merit’s name. It is not important to note which aspect of the Haven Merit on which those points are spent, as this allows greater flexibility should a character ever decide to withdraw from the community arrangement. The result looks like this:",
            "In this example, the character shares a Haven Merit dedicated to the coterie’s communal shelter. He contributes two dots to the relationship, and the group has a total of four dots that are made available to each member. The character also has his own private Haven Merit rated •••, which he maintains by himself. And, the character has Retainer rated •• that is also his own Merit."

A town high in the mountains that can only be found by the outside world but once a century. All of these are examples of the pockets of reality that changelings call Hollows — places in the Hedge that have been cleared of thorns and shaped into a stable location for inhabitation. Some Hollows are little more than a clear patch of grass in the midst of the great Thorn maze, while others are dwellings quite elaborate and fantastical. Changelings actively create many of these locations through sweat and toil, while other Hollows are simply found and adopted in an almost fully formed state.",

A fantastic Victorian mansion might be able to house an entire motley and be packed with all manner of amenities, but without the proper wards, the mansion will also act as a beacon for all manner of freeloaders and other undesirable entities. A Hollow’s strengths and weaknesses are thus tallied according to four factors — size, amenities, doors and wards.

Reflecting the relative luxuriousness of the Hollow as well as how well-stocked it is with supplies and other material comforts, this rating gives an idea of how elaborate the Hollow is as well as what a character can reasonably expect to find within it at a given time. (A character who wants a humble cabin doesn’t need to allocate much here, but a character who wants an elaborate treetop village stocked with delights should be ready to invest quite a bit.) A Hollow without any dots in Amenities contains few if any buildings or possessions — it might be big but it’s mostly empty space. At the other end of the spectrum, a retreat with five dots in amenities is likely fully stocked with all manner of luxuries, and while most of these Amenities are made of ephemeral dreamstuff and thus cannot travel across the Hedge or even that far from their origin within it, they still make for a very pleasing stay. (In other words, Hollow Amenities cannot be used as a substitute for other Merits such as Resources or Harvest, and if the character wants the things found in his Hollow to travel outside of it, he must purchase the appropriate Merits to represent these riches.) While a high Hollow Amenities rating often entails a high Hollow Size rating, exceptions do occur for example, a changeling might not invest much in Hollow Size, but then make that small cabin a veritable wonderland full of excellent food, interesting books and a magical fireplace that keeps itself at the perfect temperature all the time. Likewise, a motley might invest a lot in Hollow Size to get a giant Victorian mansion, but without much spent in Hollow Amenities, it will be sparsely furnished and likely a bit rundown.",

These magical elements should not mimic anything as powerful as Contracts, but can provide basic household services and serve as excellent descriptive details and flourishes to create exactly what the player desires for the look and feel of their Hollow. A game board with living chess or gwybdyll pieces that can play against a living opponent is a perfectly acceptable entertainment amenity, for example, as might be a battered arcade cabinet that changes every new moon to a different video game never seen in the mortal world.",

(A character may waive either of these “free” entrances if he only wishes the Hollow to be accessible from one side.) With each dot in Hollow Doors, the Hollow has one additional point of entry/exit, either in the real world or through the Hedge. For example, with the expenditure of multiple dots, each motley member might have a door in his own residence that allows him access to the group’s private Hollow.

Thus, it is wise to invest at least a few dots in Hollow Wards, representing the precautions both mundane and magical that protect the Hollow from unwanted visitors. Each dot invested in Hollow Wards subtracts one die from all attempts by unwanted visitors to find or break into the Hollow; in addition, those inside receive a +1 die bonus per dot on their Initiative compared to those attempting to break in. Lastly, the more dots invested in Hollow Wards, the less likely the location is to be found by True Fae or creatures from the Hedge; each dot subtracts one die from any rolls made to find the Hollow.",

It can be anywhere, but the Created usually choose places far from the madding crowd of mortals. If they do choose to live close to mortals, their lairs are nondescript and contain multiple means of escape. Since most lairs are only temporary, meant to serve for only a few months before the Promethean resumes his Pilgrimage, they cost relatively few dots to acquire. When the Promethean abandons his lair, however, he loses the dots. If he later returns to the area, the Storyteller might decide that the lair is still operable, although it loses one of its dots due to lack of maintenance, until the Promethean can put some effort into restoring it.",

Lairs with no dots in Lair Security can be found by anyone intent enough to look, and they offer little protection once they have been breached.

Hunters often rig a safehouse with traps, hidden weapons, security systems and escape routes, because as impregnable as it might be, monsters are persistent and clever. They’ll probably find the way in, and the best a hunter can do is make it hard on them.",

In game terms, dots spent on the Safehouse Merit need to be distributed among four categories: Size, Cache, Secrecy and Traps. Thus, the storage shed might have no dots of Size or Traps, but several of Secrecy. The apartment doesn’t hold much in the way of Cache (as the owner is afraid to leave anything there), but has a high Traps rating. The mansion has five dots in Size and probably a few in Traps and/or Cache, but none in Secrecy.",

            "<i>Safehouse Cache</i>: A lot of space is good for a very large cell, or for a cell that chooses to live in its safehouse, but it can also make the inhabitants paranoid. After all, if there are 10 rooms in the place, who knows what’s in the other nine at any given time? Hunters find that having some weapons at their fingertips lessens this paranoia somewhat (or it might make it worse, because what if the monsters find the stash?).",
            "Each dot allocated to Safehouse Cache translates to one cache. A cache can hold five Size points worth of equipment, so while one might be a weapons locker with two shotguns and a pistol (and a few boxes of ammo for each, which is negligible as far as Size goes), another might hold surveillance equipment (a set of wire taps, binoculars, night-sight goggles and maybe a pistol for good measure). Chapter Six of the World of Darkness Rulebook has some examples of equipment and weapons that might be useful, and players should work with the Storyteller to figure out what might fit in a cache. It is possible, too, to combine two or more dots of Cache into one space, for a total Size of 10 or more.",
            "Equipment doesn’t have to be stored in a cache, of course — a large safehouse can have entire rooms devoted to storage. Equipment that is stored in a cache, however, is effectively hidden from anything but a devoted (or supernatural) search. Mundane interlopers receive a -5 modifier to any attempt to find a cache (on a dramatic failure, the searcher finds and triggers a trap, instead, if the safehouse has any). If the players wish, this modifier can instead apply to attempts to access the Cache. The gun safe might be in plain view, but it’s not at all easy to crack open without the proper combination.",
            "<i>Safehouse Secrecy</i>: One of the biggest advantages a hunter can enjoy is, ironically, one that his prey tries to cultivate as well: anonymity. If the monsters don’t know where to find the hunters, they have a harder time killing them. Dots in Safehouse Secrecy indicate how far removed from the hunters the safehouse is, from a legal (and paper trail) standpoint. These dots impose a negative penalty on any attempt to find the hunter through the property, or vice versa.

That’s why many of them build traps into their safehouses, in hopes they can kill a supernatural intruder — or at least deter him long enough to get away. A trap can take a myriad of forms. Opening a door to a promising-looking room reveals a shotgun aimed at chest level, which promptly fires. Walking up the stairs on the left side is safe, but on the right side, they’re rigged to collapse. Looking behind a painting causes an ax to swing down from the ceiling, just about at head level. A trap can also be designed to destroy part (or all) of the safehouse — at the flick of a switch, the place goes up in flames, collapses or explodes (see sidebar for what this means in terms of the Merit).",

This is what differentiates traps represented by this Merit from others that the characters might build themselves during the course of the chronicle; no rolls or special effort are required to reset a Safehouse Trap. Again, though, if the trap is designed to destroy large sections of the safehouse, that damage can’t be repaired without significant effort and expense, if at all.

Players wishing to ensure privacy and safety may choose to spend dots on Sanctum Security, thus making it difficult for others to gain entrance. Sanctums with no dots in Sanctum Security can be found by those intent enough to look, and offer little protection once they have been breached. Each dot of Security subtracts one die from efforts to intrude into the place by anyone a character doesn’t specifically allow in. This increased difficulty may be because the entrance is so difficult to locate (behind a bookcase, under a carpet) or simply difficult to penetrate (behind a vault door). Also, each dot of Security offers a +1 bonus on Initiative for those inside against anyone attempting to gain entrance (good sight lines, video surveillance).",

A shared rating in the Sanctum Merit cannot rise higher than five dots in any of the two aspects of the trait. That is, characters cannot pool more than five dots to be devoted to, say, Sanctum Size. If they wish to devote extra dots to the Merit, they must allocate those dots to Security.",
            "Shared Sanctum dots can be lost. Cabal members or associates might be abused or mistreated, ending relationships. Group members might perform actions that cast themselves (or the group) in a bad light. Money might be spent or lost. If any group member does something to diminish the sanctum, its dots decrease for all group members. That’s the weakness of sharing dots in this Merit. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link. The Storyteller dictates when character actions or events in a story compromise shared Sanctum dots.",
            "Characters can also leave a shared sanctum. A rift might form between close friends. A character might be killed or lost in the Shadow Realm. Or one could be kicked out of the sanctum by the others. When a character leaves a shared sanctum relationship, the dots he contributed are removed from the pool. If the individual still survives, he doesn’t get all his dots back for his own purposes. He gets one less than he originally contributed. So, if a character breaks a relationship with his cabal, his two Sanctum dots are lost by the group, but he gets only one dot back for his own purposes. The lost dot represents the cost or bad image that comes from the breakup. If all members agree to part ways, they all lose one dot from what they originally contributed.",
            "The Storyteller decides what reduced dots means in the story when a character leaves a shared sanctum. Perhaps no one else picks up the character’s attention to Sanctum Security, leaving that score to drop. Maybe a portion of the sanctum falls into disuse or even collapses, causing an effective drop in Sanctum Size. Whatever the case, a plausible explanation must be determined.",
            "A character need not devote all of her Sanctum dots to the shared Sanctum Merit, of course. A mage might maintain a separate sanctum outside the communal one represented by the shared trait. Any leftover dots that a character has (or is unwilling to share) signify what she has to draw upon as an individual, separate from her partners. For example, three characters share a sanctum and expend a group total of five dots. One character chooses to use two other dots on a private sanctum. Those remaining two dots represent a sanctum entirely separate from what she and her partners have established together.",
            "To record a shared Sanctum Merit on your character sheet, put an asterisk next to the name of the Sanctum Merit and fill in the total dots that your character has access to thanks to his partnership. In order to record his original contribution, write it in parentheses along with the Merit’s name. It is not important to note on which aspect of the Sanctum Merit those points are spent; this allows greater flexibility should a character ever decide to withdraw from the community arrangement.",
            "In this example, the character shares a Sanctum Merit dedicated to the cabal’s communal shelter. He contributes two dots to the relationship, and the group has a total of four dots that are made available to each member. The character also has his own private Sanctum Merit rated 3, which he maintains by himself. And, the character has Retainer rated 2, which is also his own Merit."

While portable sanctums require effort to create and are limited in some fashions, they give traveling mages a measure of safety that they might otherwise find sorely lacking.",

While not precisely a spell, the creation of a portable sanctum does require a great deal of concentration, time and effort. Those who frequently travel from one location to another, staying for days or weeks at a time, are those most likely to use a portable sanctum. An archaeologist who is out on a dig for several months may erect a portable sanctum to protect the Artifacts he hopes to discover. Likewise, a diplomat sent to parlay with a foreign Consilium may set up a portable sanctum in his hotel suite, giving her a modicum of sanctuary and privacy from prying eyes. A mage who is “on the run” and pausing only to catch a few hours sleep is unlikely to spend the time or energy required to create a portable sanctum in the cheap motel he is planning on leaving at dawn, although if the situation is dire enough, he may choose to sacrifice a few hours’ travel for the extra security a portable sanctum may offer.",
            "The creation of a portable sanctum is reflected in game mechanics by an extended roll. The player rolls an extended test of Wits + Crafts or Larceny with modifiers based on how defensible and hidden the location they have chosen is. A simple tent might offer a -3 modifier, while an abandoned military bunker might give a +3, with a standard wooden room serving as the “standard” (with no modifier). Each roll is one hour, and successes are used to “buy” the sanctum’s traits as the area is set up, starting with Portability and Size and then moving into any applicable Sanctum Traits the mage’s player wishes, to a maximum of the Sanctum Merit’s normal ratings.",
            "The Portable Merit can be combined with the following other Sanctum Merits: Size, Security, Guardian Ghost*, Guardian Retainer* or Guardian Spirit*.

On his first roll, the mage’s player roll two successes, allocating them to Portability and Size; by the end of the first hour, the mage has unpacked the small trunk of motion sensors, checked the angles on the room’s entrances and windows, and generally gotten a feel for the place and figured out what he needs to do to secure it. The next hour (with the player rolling two more successes, which are placed into Security), the mage begins setting up his precautions, filling locks with grit to make them harder to pick, placing small mirrors in perfect locations to help spot those trying to sneak up and burning the specialized incenses that make the sanctum harder to find with magic. Then, with an hour until sunset, he decides to place the sanctum’s interior into the configurations that will draw the guardian spirit bound to it; his player rolls again, placing the three successes he rolls into bringing the Guardian Spirit trait into play, and then placing a third point into Security.",

In many cases, this maintenance time won’t be important, but in some stories, time is a factor. Either a whole space is successfully maintained, or it’s not. Two hours of work on a mansion that normally requires 10 hours of geomantic upkeep aren’t sufficient to maintain the bonus in two rooms, for example. The mystic alignment of the whole space must be correct, or there is no bonus. If a space goes untended for one month, its geomantic effects are suspended. To restore the bonus, your character must dedicate sufficient hours to maintenance for the month; it’s not necessary to purchase this Merit again unless you want to adjust the geomantic state of a whole new space.",

Mana seems to flow readily there, although that isn’t always the case; dark glens and hollows covered by a canopy of trees or steep peaks can still host such energy. Nonetheless, they occur most often on mountaintops, hills or at the tops of skyscrapers, giving birth to the legend of mages in their towers.",
            "A Hallow generates a number of points of Mana equal to its dots each day. A mage can transfer the power from his Hallow to replenish his own Mana points by performing an oblation (see p. 77) or using a Prime 3 spell. Each Hallow is tied to a particular time of day when this replenishment can take place — sundown, sunrise and midnight are the most common.",
            "If this Mana is not harvested, it congeals into tass, usually in the form of spring water or growing plants, or it’s imbued into stones or other objects. Some mages forbid others from harvesting free Mana, cultivating it into tass that can be stored and used later. See “Tass,” pp. 78-79.",
            "A Hallow’s Mana shares the place’s quality of resonance. Resonance quality in opposition to a spell’s effects — calm resonance for an attack spell, violent resonance for a healing spell — might levy anywhere from -1 to -2 penalties on spellcasting rolls. For this reason, mages do not let their Hallows become polluted with foreign or impure auras. They work to maintain proper resonance quality.",
            "Additionally, a Hallow’s close vicinity (five yards per dot rating) is always suffused with power. This power obviates the need to spend one point of Mana for any mage within the vicinity. Essentially, mages need not spend that one point even when it’s required, such as for improvisational spellcasting, but must spend any points in excess that are still required, such as when casting an improvisational spell that inflicts aggravated damage. This example would normally cost two points, but it costs only one within the Hallow’s vicinity. This suffuse power cannot be siphoned into something else using Prime magic or into the mage’s personal store of Mana.",

Over time, many of these ritual spaces have become enhanced with their own uncanny character, sliding partway out of this world and partway into others.",

For each dot of a single instance of this Merit, a willworker adds one die to all rolls to summon entities from the realm to which the summoning circle is attuned.

The Storyteller must oversee alterations to this Merit. See “Designing Domains,” p. 203, for guidelines on creating and altering domains.",
            "The following Domain Merits are each purchased or defined separately.",
            "<b>Domain Location (• to •••••)</b>",
            "<b>Effect:</b> This Merit generally measures how easy it is for a vampire to hunt within the Domain. Each dot of Domain Location grants a +1 bonus to hunting rolls for any character in the domain, whether resident or trespasser. This Merit also defines the maximum number of dots in Haven Location a resident Kindred can have here. Your character, as the lord of the Domain, may impose a lower maximum on a tenant, vassal, or simple resident by demanding she nest in some secluded part of the territory.",
            "This Merit is not identical to the Feeding Ground Merit. Feeding Ground represents a body of mortals suitable for hunting regardless (or even in spite of) the general atmosphere and landscape of the area. Dots in Domain Location cannot be “cashed in” for dots in Herd.",
            "This Merit is its own drawback. Better feeding grounds attract trespassers who often bring trouble with them. The lord of a domain with a good Location has to protect it.",
            "<b>Domain Quality: Interactive (• to •••••)</b>",
            "<b>Effect:</b> The Domain Quality Merit describes the Domain’s influence over actions in the area and the nature of its populace. In practical terms, it defines the maximum modifiers, positive or negative, the Domain can have in its Interactive Attributes (see p. 251). An Interactive Attribute can have a positive or negative modifier up to the number of dots in this Merit.",
            "Thus, with two dots in this Merit, the Domain can have a +1, -1, +2 or -2 ratings in Access, Information, and Prestige. An Attribute does not have to be rated to the maximum possible modifier, but no Attribute’s modifier can exceed the dots in this Merit. So, with Domain Quality: Interactive •• the Domain could have Access -2, Information +1 and Prestige +2.",
            "<b>Domain Quality: Reactive (• to •••••)</b>",
            "<b>Effect:</b> The Domain Quality Merit describes the Domain’s influence over actions in the area and the nature of its populace. In practical terms, it defines the maximum modifiers, positive or negative, the Domain can have in its Reactive Attributes (see p. 251). A Reactive Attribute can have a positive or negative modifier up to the number of dots in this Merit.",
            "Thus, with two dots in this Merit, the Domain can have a +1, -1, +2 or -2 ratings in Safety, Awareness and Stability. An Attribute does not have to be rated to the maximum possible modifier, but no Attribute’s modifier can exceed the dots in this Merit. So, with Domain Quality: Reactive ••• the Domain could have Safety +2, Information -3 and Prestige -1.",
            "<b>Domain Size (• to •••••)</b>",
            "<b>Effect:</b> Domain Size measures the amount of physical ground your Domain covers. More is not always better. A larger Domain means more land to patrol and defend, more space for Kindred trespassers to slip in or even lair unnoticed, and more room for troubles to emerge. More land, however, generally also means greater Status and prestige among other Kindred in the feudal hierarchy.",
            "Domain Size isn’t a precise measure of blocks or miles. It’s a relative measure of the domain compared to the city and its Districts. In general, each dot of Domain Size should correspond roughly to the lord’s station in the feudal hierarchy — the lowliest domains are Domain Size • while all but the most modest or token-appointed Regents are Domain Size •••••. (The Prince doesn’t count his dominion by Domain Size as his Domain trumps everyone else’s — it’s the whole damn city.) In some cities a single dot of Domain Size might represent three or four blocks of turf while in others it could be nine or ten streets wide. It depends on the size of the city and the Prince’s standards for the number of domains her city should have.",
            "The guiding rule of Domain Size is its relationship to the Tenant and Vassal Merits. Your character can purchase a Tenant or Vassal Merit once for each dot of Domain Size. Resident Kindred who keep havens in the domain, but have no formal claim to land under the lord, count for about half a dot of Domain Size as an abstract measurement, but the Storyteller should adjust that measurement relative to the size of the domain. A nest with five dots in Haven Size may be worth a whole dot of Domain Size in a small city or crowded District where a mansion sized lair would be almost impossible to maintain under the Masquerade. The Masquerade is always a looming factor in determining what kinds of havens are suitable for the Domain Size. (But don’t discount the ability of a domain to contain hidden networks of rooms in defunct office buildings or even abandoned subway stations serving as palatial havens.)",
            "This Merit, therefore, doesn’t necessarily limit the number of dots that local havens can have in Haven Size. The Storyteller has the right to set a limit in order to reflect the nature of the domain’s neighborhood, but it’s not essential. Regardless of limits imposed by the domain, the lord of the land always has the right to limit the size of local havens. It’s his right to decide how much of his land another Kindred receives. Some lords cite the Masquerade when forcing their tenants into smaller havens, but the fact is that lordly fiat is all the justification they need.",
            "<b>Domain Security (• to •••••)</b>",
            "Domain Security reflects the general safety of the area, either as the result of police oversight or the proximity of Hounds or a surplus of gated condos and iron grilled storefronts. Domain Security interacts with the local District’s Attributes (and thus the Domain Quality Merits) but doesn’t override them. Neither does it dictate a limit on Haven Security dots in the domain.",
            "Domain Security modifies the likelihood of thieves and muggers in the domain. Each dot of Domain Security imposes a -1 die penalty on rolls to locate or hire characters specializing in Skills like Larceny, Stealth, Streetwise, and Subterfuge. This penalty does not apply to the actual physical acts of breaking and entering, though; that’s covered by the Security dots of individual buildings like havens. Rather, Domain Security reduces the need for dots in Haven Security.",
            "The Storyteller could assume that an average neighborhood in the city is prowled by muggers and thieves with an average dice pool of 7 plus or minus Stability modifiers. The Storyteller rolls that particular dice pool to determine if a random act of crime or violence emerges from the background to spice up the chapter. A success indicates a couple of muggers or a car thief. An exceptional success could indicate an armed robbery, drive-by shooting, or open shootout in the street. Dots in Domain Security, modified by Safety, are rolled to contest the random crime roll.",
            "The domain’s rating in Haven Security (modified by District Attributes) can be rolled, with each success reducing the response time by one minute from a base starting time of ten minutes, to determine the response time of local police.",
            "Strictly speaking, a lord may impose a ruling on the security measures of local havens — declaring blaring alarms off limits or demanding Kindred have barred windows — but it is not his feudal right to do so. The space within a Kindred’s haven is his own. That is where every vampire is a lord."

Even with a large or rich hunting ground (•••• or •••••, say), your character does not have any feudal rank without the City Status Merit or any real authority without the Domain Merit.",
            "Exclusive hunting grounds grant a dice pool bonus to hunting attempts made therein. That bonus should range from +1 to +3. Each increasing bonus in hunting dice pools should be proportionally rare and at a rarity determined by the Storyteller to represent the scarcity or bounty of easy Vitae in the domain. For example, there may be four hunting grounds of +3 value in the domain, 12 of +2 value, and 36 of +1 value. These values are not cumulative; time spent hunting in one feeding ground precludes time spent hunting in another.",
            "As an option, the player may choose to “cash in” a hunting ground in order to cultivate a number of Herd Merit points equal to the original bonus. This effectively reduces the bonus of that hunting ground to +0 permanently. (Kindred may continue to hunt there, but they simply don’t gain the benefit of the bonus anymore.)",
            "Multiple Kindred may share the benefit of a plentiful hunting ground, but overtaxing the local vessels is a quick way to scare people off and thus reduce the bonus. Each time in one month that more than a single character takes advantage of the bonus in a specific hunting ground on a single night, make a note of it. If such occurs more than the value of the bonus in that single month, the bonus is negated completely until the Storyteller deems otherwise."

            "You define the specific terms of service your character demands from his tenants, but the Storyteller can veto your terms if no local Kindred will agree to them. In general, each dot in this Merit entitles your character to five Vitae per month, which is one expenditure equal to about Resources • (multiple dots do not equate to a higher Resources value, but rather more frequent use of Resources •), temporary access to a piece of equipment worth +1 to +3 in bonuses, or one night’s use of a Retainer worth the same value as this Merit. The specific benefit of the Tenant Merit must be decided when the Merit is purchased. If the Storyteller agrees, however, the Merit can be renegotiated with the tenant later.",

            "<b>Drawback:</b> Tenants can cause trouble. Because tenants do not have the same kind of authority or responsibility over the land, they cannot be expected to defend the domain or solve problems on site unless the lord calls in the corvée. This Merit essentially comes with a linked Flaw. Every time your character collects his corvée, the Storyteller may roll a dice pool equal to 7 - the dots for that Tenant Merit. If the Storyteller gets a success, the tenant in involved in some kind of trouble, such as attracting unwanted mortal attention or causing damage to the Domain or a Site that temporarily reduces its value by one point.
