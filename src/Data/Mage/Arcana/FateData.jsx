        "DescrizioneMiddle": "<p>When someone directs a vulgar spell at the mage or other targets whom the mage wishes to protect, he can cast a countering spell that creates a form of magical interference, weakening or even canceling the attacking spell, similar to how an obstacle can act as cover against a ranged attack. He must first have Mage Sight to be able to perceive the attacking spell. Like a dodge action, he can cast Counterspell against vulgar spells cast by another mage with a higher Initiative. (He cannot counter attacks with lower Initiatives if he has already performed an action in the turn. See “Dodge,” p. 156 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, for rules on how this circumvents the normal Initiative order for the turn.) A mage can even counter sympathetic spells cast directly at him (but not those cast at other targets), by sensing the sympathetic conduit being forged by the spell (again, he must have Mage Sight for this). </p><p>Successes are subtracted from the target spell’s Potency. If the target spell is left with no Potency, it is canceled entirely. If even a single point of Potency remains, the spell is applied against its target (at its reduced Potency). </p><p>A covert spell cannot normally be countered, since the defending mage must first identify its Arcanum components using the normal rules for doing so (see “Scrutinizing Spells,” p. 278). Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell. For example, to counter a conjunctional Mind 3 + Life 2 spell, a mage needs either Mind 1 or Life 1, but not both. If he does not have a proper Arcanum lore, he cannot counter the spell. Counterspell can be learned as a rote (use Occult Skill), but it must be learned separately for each Arcanum to which it applies.</p><p>A mage with two dots of Prime can instead use the “Counterspell Prime” spell, p. 222, to counter any spell, regardless of Arcanum. In addition, Counterspell Prime allows him to counter covert spells (assuming he has active Mage Sight) without first needing to identify them.</p>",

The “Loyal Possession” spell takes effect through a series of subtle turns of fate and slight of mind. <p>Example: Zeno’s cell phone is stolen from him, but it has Loyal Possession cast upon it. So the thief accidentally runs into someone on the street and drops the phone into a trashcan without noticing. Later, a homeless woman fishes the cell phone out of the trash and carries it for several blocks. She leaves it in an alley behind a local pizza parlor. A kid working there comes out back to empty the trash and picks up the phone on his way back in. He idly wipes it down with a damp rag and sticks it in his pocket. A call comes in for delivery of a large sausage and mushroom pizza, and the kid wraps the phone up in a sheet of foil and sticks it into the pizza box without even thinking about it. The delivery guy takes the pizza to the customer’s address, and when Zeno gets his dinner, he unwraps the foil to find his missing phone. “There you are,” he says. “It’s about bloody time, too.”</p><p>The exact sequence of events is left to the Storyteller’s imagination (with input from the caster’s player, as desired). Sleepers can act as unwitting agents of a Loyal Possession without being consciously aware they are doing so, and seemingly “random” events can conspire to help get things done. Exactly how long it takes the object to get back to its owner depends greatly on circumstances: a small item could cross an urban area in mere hours, while a larger item could take days. There are also a few limits on the effect. First, the spell doesn’t work if the item’s owner willingly gives it away (even under duress). So if you hand a Loyal Possession to someone, it’s effectively “theirs,” and the spell isn’t triggered, but is actually transferred to the new “owner.” This can be used to grant others Loyal Possessions, however.</p><p>Second, if the item ends up in the possession of an Awakened character, he can hold on to it so long as he keeps the item on his person. So if an Awakened enemy takes a Loyal Possession from you, for example, and keeps it in his pocket, it stays with him. However, as soon as the item is out of the Awakened character’s possession, it may try to find its way “home.” So, if your foe happens to put the Loyal Possession down on a desk or side table, for example, the Loyal Possession might get picked up by a Sleeper servant or bystander, knocked out a window or into the garbage and so forth, slipping the net to start its journey back.</p> <p>Finally, a Loyal Possession brought inside a ward (see <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 236) loses its “fix” on its owner and cannot continue to return until the item is brought outside the ward, and the item can’t influence events to help bring it outside. It becomes “stuck” in the warded area. Short of undoing the spell, this is the surest way to hold on to a Loyal Possession that doesn’t belong to you. This spell is commonly imbued in certain valuable items, and a number of artifacts display similar capabilities (although artifacts are often more capricious about “ownership,” sometimes just conspiring to seek a new and suitable “owner” when circumstances require it).</p>",

        "DescrizioneMiddle": "The mage must fashion a summoning circle, usually sing runes and High Speech glyphs appropriate not only to the Arcanum he is using, but to the intended purpose of the summoning. The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper’s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player’s descriptions of his character’s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage’s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character’s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character’s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage’s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start — 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim’s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim’s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned “home,” the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell “open” is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough — the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50’ of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",

        "RoteDescrizione": "This rote drives to the heart of the new philosophies on magic espoused by the Free Council. It unleashes chaotic happenings upon a world that most people would rather be ordered and safe, but opens people to the possibility that the universe isn’t always as it seems, causing even the dimmest of Sleepers to wonder what other mysteries are still out there. Also, as some members of the order are quick to point out, it makes one hell of a smokescreen when attempting a hasty getaway.",

The spell is buried in a long, moving poem written to Eurydice by Orpheus. Part of the poem remarks upon her beauty and her grace, but much of it is a collection of moments — descriptions of how sunlight played on her hair on a particular day, or the sound of her laugh or of something she whispered to him while they made love. The spell itself does not create love, but gives it a supernatural depth. Lovers who undertake this spell must be very, very careful — if love sours, this spell becomes a curse.",

This can be an elaborate vow or a simple “I love you,” but when the spell is complete, the love takes on a <i>geas</i>-like quality. From then on, the lovers enjoy the following effects:<ul><li>Each can sense when the other is in pain or in danger, from any distance. No information about the particular reason for the distress is granted, only a sudden feeling of fear.</li><li>Each of the lovers can spend Willpower for the other. This enables the lovers to enjoy the effects of 2 Willpower points (for a total of +6) on a given roll.</li><li>If the lovers are together, any reflexive resistance rolls made to counter supernatural mind or emotion-controlling powers are made jointly. For instance, if a spell is contested against Composure + Gnosis, <i>both</i> lovers make this roll and the successes are totaled. The aggressor must beat this total in order to affect the target. If the power subtracts a Resistance trait instead of calling for a resistance roll, the aggressor subtracts both lovers’ traits.</li></ul><p>This spell is always cast with a conditional Duration. (See p. 150 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>.) The condition is this: If one lover betrays the other, the spell’s effects immediately end and each party becomes unable to regain Willpower by <i>any</i> method while the other lives. This is, of course, a fairly easy situation to remedy...</p>",
