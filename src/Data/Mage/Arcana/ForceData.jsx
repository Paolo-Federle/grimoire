        "DescrizioneMiddle": "<p>When someone directs a vulgar spell at the mage or other targets whom the mage wishes to protect, he can cast a countering spell that creates a form of magical interference, weakening or even canceling the attacking spell, similar to how an obstacle can act as cover against a ranged attack. He must first have Mage Sight to be able to perceive the attacking spell. Like a dodge action, he can cast Counterspell against vulgar spells cast by another mage with a higher Initiative. (He cannot counter attacks with lower Initiatives if he has already performed an action in the turn. See “Dodge,” p. 156 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, for rules on how this circumvents the normal Initiative order for the turn.) A mage can even counter sympathetic spells cast directly at him (but not those cast at other targets), by sensing the sympathetic conduit being forged by the spell (again, he must have Mage Sight for this). </p><p>Successes are subtracted from the target spell’s Potency. If the target spell is left with no Potency, it is canceled entirely. If even a single point of Potency remains, the spell is applied against its target (at its reduced Potency). </p><p>A covert spell cannot normally be countered, since the defending mage must first identify its Arcanum components using the normal rules for doing so (see “Scrutinizing Spells,” p. 278). Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell. For example, to counter a conjunctional Mind 3 + Life 2 spell, a mage needs either Mind 1 or Life 1, but not both. If he does not have a proper Arcanum lore, he cannot counter the spell. Counterspell can be learned as a rote (use Occult Skill), but it must be learned separately for each Arcanum to which it applies.</p><p>A mage with two dots of Prime can instead use the “Counterspell Prime” spell, p. 222, to counter any spell, regardless of Arcanum. In addition, Counterspell Prime allows him to counter covert spells (assuming he has active Mage Sight) without first needing to identify them.</p>",

In addition, a Sleeper’s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player’s descriptions of his character’s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage’s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character’s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character’s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage’s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start — 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim’s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim’s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned “home,” the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell “open” is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough — the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50’ of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",

In the early summer of 1920, while tourists flocked to the shores of the eastern United States, the bitter Obrimos waged war against the blossoming spirits of corruption and vice that were springing up throughout the area. A number of the mages of Phosphorous’ Consilium were against these unprovoked attacks, and more than one chastised the Arrow for creating such a one-dimensional spell; what good would come of such destructive power? They soon found out when one local mystagogue got in over his head. “Dapper” Dave hadn’t intended any harm by it, but whatever it was that he dredged up from the Underworld longed only to destroy. Phosphorous answered its aggression with the fury of her magic, unleashing this brutal spell upon the creature, until it troubled the Consilium no more.

The victim suffers –1 to all Physical dice pools.</p><p><b>2 points:</b> Nausea. If the victim moves more than half his Speed in a turn, a reflexive Stamina + Composure roll is required to avoid vomiting for that turn. While vomiting, the victim cannot take any other action, although he still gains his Defense.</p><p><b>3 points:</b> Bleeding from an orifice. The victim suffers one point of bashing damage. This damage does not heal as long as the victim is still exposed. In addition, long-term health problems such as cancer might develop in later years.</p><p><b>4 points:</b> Skin burns. The victim suffers one point of bashing damage this turn and per successive 10 minutes of exposure. This damage does not heal as long as the victim is still exposed.</p><p><b>5 points:</b> Fainting. A reflexive Stamina + Resolve roll is made for the victim to avoid falling unconscious for a number of minutes equal to any radiation damage he has already suffered. Any new damage he suffers due to exposure while unconscious adds to this time. Once he awakens, the roll must be made again each turn if he is still exposed.</p><p>Ongoing exposure continues to inflict damage until a victim is dead of aggravated wounds.</p>",

When the spell is cast on a living creature, its Speed trait is doubled or halved per success, but it is not in full control and reflexive Dexterity + Athletics rolls must be made each turn it moves or the subject suffers a knockdown effect (p. 168 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>). The creature’s Speed is modified for the spell’s Duration (default of one turn).</p><p>In the case of projectiles, one success is enough to completely halt a projectile halfway in its path (or as close between there and its target as the mage desires). Additional successes can halt it closer and closer to its origin point, and an exceptional success can halt a bullet in the barrel of a gun. For instance, with two successes, a bullet is stopped after it travels only one-quarter the way from the barrel to its intended target (one success stops it halfway, while the second success halves that distance again).</p><p>The mage can affect multiple projectiles by adding extra Target factors. See “Target,” p. 118. Note that in the case of halting multiple bullets from the same gun (such as stopping machine gun fire), use the following special Target factors chart:</p>[TABLE1]",
