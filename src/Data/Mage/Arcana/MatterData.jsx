He must first have Mage Sight to be able to perceive the attacking spell. Like a dodge action, he can cast Counterspell against vulgar spells cast by another mage with a higher Initiative. (He cannot counter attacks with lower Initiatives if he has already performed an action in the turn. See “Dodge,” p. 156 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, for rules on how this circumvents the normal Initiative order for the turn.) A mage can even counter sympathetic spells cast directly at him (but not those cast at other targets), by sensing the sympathetic conduit being forged by the spell (again, he must have Mage Sight for this). </p><p>Successes are subtracted from the target spell’s Potency. If the target spell is left with no Potency, it is canceled entirely. If even a single point of Potency remains, the spell is applied against its target (at its reduced Potency). </p><p>A covert spell cannot normally be countered, since the defending mage must first identify its Arcanum components using the normal rules for doing so (see “Scrutinizing Spells,” p. 278). Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell. For example, to counter a conjunctional Mind 3 + Life 2 spell, a mage needs either Mind 1 or Life 1, but not both. If he does not have a proper Arcanum lore, he cannot counter the spell. Counterspell can be learned as a rote (use Occult Skill), but it must be learned separately for each Arcanum to which it applies.</p><p>A mage with two dots of Prime can instead use the “Counterspell Prime” spell, p. 222, to counter any spell, regardless of Arcanum. In addition, Counterspell Prime allows him to counter covert spells (assuming he has active Mage Sight) without first needing to identify them.</p>",

In addition to cars being able to turn themselves on and drive, guns being able to fire, and locks being able to lock and unlock, animated objects can also move on their own. Pieces of furniture can roll on their wheels or walk and run on their legs, knives and guns can hop around and even throw themselves at targets, and drawers can slide out with sufficient force to injure someone. When an object attacks, use the spirit’s Power as its Strength. Animated objects can bend and flex in various unnatural ways. Most of their more extreme types of movement, such as a chair running across a room, are subject to Disbelief.</p><p>One limit on this spell is that unless the mage also uses Spirit magic like the “Control Spirit” spell, the object is free to act as it chooses. Objects owned by the mage will typically obey her commands, as will objects not asked to do anything self-destructive or against their inherent nature. (Guns normally attack people, drawers and chairs do not.) Objects that have been treated well by someone will not normally attack this person. Guns owned by a gun collector who takes excellent care of them will not attack the collector simply because the mage asks them to. In fact, the guns are more likely to fire at anyone attacking their owner, including the mage who cast this spell.</p><p>This spell can be used to animate any object of size 20 or less, +10 per additional Target factor.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper’s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player’s descriptions of his character’s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage’s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character’s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character’s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage’s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start — 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim’s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim’s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned “home,” the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell “open” is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough — the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50’ of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",

The mage need not sculpt the Golem himself, if he so chooses. Once the Golem is in place, two black candles (for Binah) are lit at the head and foot of the Golem, and the mage begins to carve sacred runes into the body of the inert statue (both to represent Hod and to provide the additional duration from Atlantean runes). The mage then chants in the accented High Speech favored by Kabbalists for thirty minutes before beginning the invocation proper, which involves readings from scripture and invocations to the archangels of the sephiroth. The traditional target number aimed for by Kabbalists is nine: five applied to the spell's Potency and four to its Duration (allowing the Golem to exist for two days, or indefinitely if the caster is a Master, counting the Atlantean rune bonus), but the caster is free to set his own desired target number. Often, the rote concludes with the mage writing the Hebrew word Emet (“Life”) on the Golem's forehead and setting the conditional duration to specify that the Golem will be destroyed if the first letter is erased, rendering the word Meit (“Death”).",

Tiny imp-like creatures are good at creeping into small places and spying undetected on one’s enemies. If every mage were a 13-year-old boy, the earth would no doubt be crawling with towering, gigantic homunculi that would periodically meet to engage in titanic combat. Fortunately for everyone, the Guardians of the Veil take an especially dim view of such nonsense, and make destroying oversized, outré homunculi — and the fools who attempt to construct them — a top priority.</p><p>The alchemist must have access to an Alchemical Lab in order to perform this spell.</p>[TABLE1]<p>Next, the alchemist determines whether the homunculus resonates as human. If it has some human qualities, it can be affected, for good or for ill, by spells that target people. To permit human resonance, the alchemist must incorporate a quantity of human flesh and/or bone into his creature. This will in turn subject the homunculus to aging and decay, giving it a set lifespan, after which it will wither and die.</p>[TABLE2]*Add an additional two successes for each extra 25 years of life<p>When selecting tissue donors, proto builders must also be aware that their personality traits may reappear, in exaggerated form, in the finished homunculus.</p><p>Next the alchemist infuses the proto with its Physical Attributes, at a rate of one success per dot, to a limit of five dots per Trait.</p><p>The alchemist may gift the proto with any number of Physical Skills, at one success per dot, to a limit of five dots per Trait. </p><p>The homunculus’ outer surfaces may then be armored. As Armor increases, the homunculus’ outward appearance becomes increasingly bizarre. At one point of Armor, its skin seems hard and woody. At two points, it gains a waxy sheen. At three points, studs of bone appear across the surface of the skin. At four points, a thick, horny plates, reminiscent of a dinosaur, manifest. At five points, the surface takes on a stony quality. At six and above, the homunculus becomes metallic. Highly armored homunculi are sometimes referred to as golems.</p>[TABLE3]<p>Alchemists with a taste for the exotic may equip their homunculi with natural weapons, from claws to horns to blades emerging from the forearms. As alchemists contemplate the baroque possibilities, they should remember that Guardians of the Veil hit squads have been known to target notably bizarre homunculi, and their creators.</p><p>Successes required for inherent weaponry are keyed to the damage dealt.</p>[TABLE4]<p>Rare alchemical texts may include instructions for even more exotic bodily features, from wings to secret compartments. The success cost for such embellishments is left as an exercise for the indulgent Storyteller.</p><p>Creatures of inhuman appearance are subject to the same damage from Disbelief as fanciful beings created with the “Hereditary Change” spell (see <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 192). They take Disbelief successes as bashing damage, once per scene, per witnessing Sleeper.</p><p>Failures on the casting roll to create a homunculus do not destroy a proto, but do deform it. With each failure, a small but noticeable visible imperfection appears on the proto’s body. Examples include scars, blemishes, drooping eyelids, gnarls of flesh and malformed or missing teeth.</p><p>With each dramatic failure, the spell must be started over. If the same gross material is used on a later attempt, weird physical features manifest, even if the next spell is cast without failures. A notably horrific physical feature appears: a withered arm, shark-like teeth, a useless third eye, a second face on the back of the head, tentacle-like growths or whatever other unpleasantries strike the Storyteller’s fancy.</p><p>Some mages deliberately handicap themselves for at least one casting, to ensure that their creation will be in some way imperfect. They thereby render the creation process less of an act of hubris — see the sidebar, below.</p>",

(Note: Transmuted versions of such materials are not acceptable.) The result, when properly crafted, a flawlessly mirrored substance. When charged with Mana, thaumium has a faint luminescence.
