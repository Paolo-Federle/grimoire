He must first have Mage Sight to be able to perceive the attacking spell. Like a dodge action, he can cast Counterspell against vulgar spells cast by another mage with a higher Initiative. (He cannot counter attacks with lower Initiatives if he has already performed an action in the turn. See “Dodge,” p. 156 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, for rules on how this circumvents the normal Initiative order for the turn.) A mage can even counter sympathetic spells cast directly at him (but not those cast at other targets), by sensing the sympathetic conduit being forged by the spell (again, he must have Mage Sight for this). </p><p>Successes are subtracted from the target spell’s Potency. If the target spell is left with no Potency, it is canceled entirely. If even a single point of Potency remains, the spell is applied against its target (at its reduced Potency). </p><p>A covert spell cannot normally be countered, since the defending mage must first identify its Arcanum components using the normal rules for doing so (see “Scrutinizing Spells,” p. 278). Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell. For example, to counter a conjunctional Mind 3 + Life 2 spell, a mage needs either Mind 1 or Life 1, but not both. If he does not have a proper Arcanum lore, he cannot counter the spell. Counterspell can be learned as a rote (use Occult Skill), but it must be learned separately for each Arcanum to which it applies.</p><p>A mage with two dots of Prime can instead use the “Counterspell Prime” spell, p. 222, to counter any spell, regardless of Arcanum. In addition, Counterspell Prime allows him to counter covert spells (assuming he has active Mage Sight) without first needing to identify them.</p>"

Whatever the case, she figured out how to unlock the thing and a small horde of skittering things poured out of it from Elsewhere. Robert Baron, local leader of the Guardians of the Veil, however, happened to be a quick thinker, with a bit of experience summoning unpleasant things from worlds without names, and he recognized the telltale signs of alien entities. No one is rightly sure if he already knew this spell when he went on the hunt; if he didn’t, though, he certainly came up with it with suspicious alacrity. Reluctantly, Baron taught his rote to as many mages as he needed to curb the infestation, and then he vanished inexplicably at its conclusion."

Although not widely known outside of the forbidden ranks of the Unforgotten Scions, this spell can also be cast more aggressively on a Sleeper target, in which case the spell costs one Mana point. If the spell succeeds, the target not only remembers the branded information forever but also develops a perverse fascination to share the knowledge with others per the Fixation derangement (see the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, p. 97); this derangement potentially flares up whenever the subject of the information comes up in conversation or the target is actively reminded of it, promoting the usual Resolve + Composure roll to resist. Any new fixation implanted this way replaces all existing ones, so a victim only needs to worry about the most recent obsession. Furthermore, he may permanently overcome such madness by spending one dot of Willpower or raising his Morality; otherwise, such madness is permanent.

However, if a particularly listener is strongly inclined to feel otherwise about the piece of media, this spell cannot override such a strong conviction.</p> <p>Although the thoughts and emotions produced by this spell only directly affect the target while he is watching or listening to the media containing the subliminal message, the effects of these thoughts and emotions generally linger well beyond the end of the spell. If the mage is using this spell to affect viewers’ reactions to a story or rumor other than the one that she is placing the subliminal message in, then the spell becomes more difficult.</p> [TABLE1] <p>A closely related story is one on the same topic, such as a specific UFO sighting or a particular fire in a warehouse district. A distantly related story is one that is about UFOs, fires or the warehouse district in question. Much of the power of this spell comes from the fact that Sleepers are trained to believe in the mass media. While this spell can be used to implant subliminal messages that make Sleepers less likely to disbelieve evidence of magic, impose a one die penalty on any such rolls, because even the mass media has difficulty overcoming the great power of the Abyss. </p>",

However, in these days of bloggers and electronic media, stopping everyone who has seen an act of vulgar magic from reporting it is no longer always possible. Instead, the Guardians must be content to discredit both the source of the information and the information itself. If the Guardians cannot use this rote on the actual source of information, either because it was a live broadcast or because it is a rumor spread by word of mouth, or printed in a book or newspaper, they implant information in all manner of related electronic media that influences the public’s view of the original source. While it is often impossible to stop a rumor, Guardians who are skilled with this rote can often alter the nature of a story so that their revised version swiftly replaces the story they wish to suppress. Guardians have numerous uses for this spell that do not directly involve causing the public to disbelieve a specific piece of evidence for the existence of magic. However, using this (or any other) spell to cause Sleepers to believe in magic more is one of the most serious crimes one of the Guardians of the Veil can commit, unless this is done inside of the strictures of an occult Labyrinth, where the Sleeper’s belief in a conspiracy theory or occult phenomena might be the key to redirecting that Sleeper into falsehoods. In such cases, it may be necessary at times to foment someone’s belief in the occult."

Alternatively, the caster can use Mind 4 to determine if a particular name, image, sound, face, or some other short phrase or simple sensory impression evokes a strong response from the people in the designated area. When used in this fashion, the spell both reveals the approximate proportion of the people who feel a particular way about the image or phrase and roughly how they feel about it. With the addition of Time magic, this spell can also be used to determine how residents of this region responded in the past. The complexity of receiving and analyzing so much information is the reason that this spell can only be performed as an extended action.

Lucia never found a lich, however, as none existed within the Consilium to find. Instead, she discovered that the rumor had been seeded by two Seers of the Throne who had quietly replaced Councilors, and that they were using the paranoia that the story engendered to gradually weaken any hope of concerted resistance when the time came for their allies to strike.

It remains a popular and well-used rote to this day and is often shared amongst the ranks of the Free Council and beyond."

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper’s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player’s descriptions of his character’s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage’s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character’s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character’s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage’s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start — 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim’s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim’s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned “home,” the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell “open” is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough — the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50’ of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>"

        "RoteDescrizione": "<p>Because of the elaborate casting ritual traditionally involved, many Kabbalists incorporate Space 2 to cast this rote sympathetically. The Pulsa di Nura, as this spell is traditionally named, begins in the Kabbalist's preferred ritual space. An altar draped with red cloth (for Gevurah) and set with purple candles (for Yesod and Death) is the centerpiece of the ritual. As with most Kabbalist spells, it begins with chanting in the High Speech for a half an hour. Once the ritual proper is begun, the mage takes up a silver dagger (representing both Chokhmah and his desire to do harm), with which he traces the names of Michael and Kamael in the air above the altar. Finally, at the completion of the casting, he pierces an image of the desired target (or another object which has sympathy to the target) with the dagger, then transfers the object to a burning brazier to be consumed. If the ritual is performed during the astrological hour of Mars (for example, at dawn on a Tuesday), the Mana cost is waived.</p><p>There is no common consensus as to the appropriate number of successes the willworker should target with this spell. Most agree that it should last no less than two days, so five successes are often allocated to Duration; alternately, the spell's conditional duration is often set so that the spell expires if the target deviates from a course of action the caster finds displeasing — for example, a Pulsa di Nura cast on a businessman might be set to end if the target gives up his efforts to buy the apartment building that houses the mage's sanctum. Successes devoted to Potency range from one (if the caster only wishes to gently goad the target) to ten or more for truly Biblical-scale vengeance.</p>"

The homunculus’ Mental Skills also cost one success per dot, with a limit of five dots per Skill. Social Skills obey the same limit but cost three successes per dot. Next the alchemist determines the degree of loyalty the homunculus feels toward its owner at the beginning of its career.

They generally model themselves either on the human donors of their organic tissue, if any, or on the alchemists who construct the homunculi’s personalities. They conduct themselves as one-dimensional parodies of their models, which can be disconcerting, especially to the persons they’re aping. By allocating five successes to the homunculus’ personality, the alchemist can specify another role model. The creature will still seem off-putting, but in a different, presumably more acceptable way. The proto must be left to spend significant time with the role model during personality formation. Spirits and ghosts, as well as living persons, can act as role models. The model may be physically present or represented by extensive audio or video recordings. It is therefore possible to imprint a homunculus with the persona of a public figure, celebrity or even a fictional character. When animated, this primal personality may be complicated by one or more derangements or Flaws (see below). The alchemist can prepare for this by choosing one derangement or Flaw for every five successes allocated for this purpose.

Successes can be split between Potency, the Size of the creature (one success adds one to Size) and the heat of the fire (see the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, p. 180 — each success adds one level to the intensity of the fire). A servant with one point of Potency has a flame that has the size and produces the heat of a torch. If the fiery creature tries to burn a person, it has an attacking dice pool equivalent to its creator’s Gnosis + 2, and causes lethal damage. If the creature causes more than two points of damage on its first attack, the creature sets its target on fire, causing another point of lethal damage every round following, until the fire is put out.<p>Although obviously magical (and subject to Disbelief), the creature is made of nothing more than fire, and can be destroyed immediately by a fire extinguisher or a large bucket of water.</p>The creature is only barely sentient.

There exist certain interesting complications to this process, however. <p>First, the subject must be willing and desirous of sincere repentance. Of course, part and parcel with a failed degeneration check is a feeling of vindication in one’s improper actions, so this true longing for redemption is often easier said than done, and usually works better with either those who are, by nature, intensely virtuous or, conversely, those who have perceived an overarching pattern of wrongful behavior in themselves and wish to turn back from the path of hubris. Whatever the case, it is only a genuine commitment to self-betterment that empowers this spell’s soul- mending effects.</p><p>Second, the spell isn’t a guarantee; merely a chance. The subject receives the opportunity to re-roll the degeneration check, automatically subject to a +1 die bonus for sincere remorse.

In the case of any act at least 2 dots <i>above</i> the Guardian’s present Wisdom score on the hierarchy of sins (see <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 79), this entails no degeneration check: his soul is simply too scarred already to suffer appreciably on account of this new burden.

Whether this is on account of metaphysical proximity to Plures’ ideology of eternal sacrifice or some other reason is unknown; some Guardians have spent years researching the seemingly enhanced moral and psychological resiliency of an owner of the <i>Codex</i>, but to no avail.

The book possesses the caster’s Virtue and Vice as well.</p><p>Note: This spell provides an exception for the usual rules for spell control, in that this spell can be cast again before the first spell expires, extending the book’s life.</p>",
