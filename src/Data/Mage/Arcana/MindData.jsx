        "DescrizioneMiddle": "<p>When someone directs a vulgar spell at the mage or other targets whom the mage wishes to protect, he can cast a countering spell that creates a form of magical interference, weakening or even canceling the attacking spell, similar to how an obstacle can act as cover against a ranged attack. He must first have Mage Sight to be able to perceive the attacking spell. Like a dodge action, he can cast Counterspell against vulgar spells cast by another mage with a higher Initiative. (He cannot counter attacks with lower Initiatives if he has already performed an action in the turn. See “Dodge,” p. 156 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, for rules on how this circumvents the normal Initiative order for the turn.) A mage can even counter sympathetic spells cast directly at him (but not those cast at other targets), by sensing the sympathetic conduit being forged by the spell (again, he must have Mage Sight for this). </p><p>Successes are subtracted from the target spell’s Potency. If the target spell is left with no Potency, it is canceled entirely. If even a single point of Potency remains, the spell is applied against its target (at its reduced Potency). </p><p>A covert spell cannot normally be countered, since the defending mage must first identify its Arcanum components using the normal rules for doing so (see “Scrutinizing Spells,” p. 278). Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell. For example, to counter a conjunctional Mind 3 + Life 2 spell, a mage needs either Mind 1 or Life 1, but not both. If he does not have a proper Arcanum lore, he cannot counter the spell. Counterspell can be learned as a rote (use Occult Skill), but it must be learned separately for each Arcanum to which it applies.</p><p>A mage with two dots of Prime can instead use the “Counterspell Prime” spell, p. 222, to counter any spell, regardless of Arcanum. In addition, Counterspell Prime allows him to counter covert spells (assuming he has active Mage Sight) without first needing to identify them.</p>",

Whatever the case, she figured out how to unlock the thing and a small horde of skittering things poured out of it from Elsewhere.

No one is rightly sure if he already knew this spell when he went on the hunt; if he didn’t, though, he certainly came up with it with suspicious alacrity.

Furthermore, he may permanently overcome such madness by spending one dot of Willpower or raising his Morality; otherwise, such madness is permanent.

She does not, however, gain two extra Willpower points.</i></p><p>Note that the same spell cast to boost a different Mental or Social Attribute does not combine with the first spell — only the highest Potency spell takes effect. For example, if a mage boosts his Intelligence by two dots and then casts a spell boosting his Wits by one dot, only the first spell applies, since it has the higher Potency.

There are so many celebrities now, in so many fields, that it’s impossible to keep track of them. A clever magician can use this to his own advantage, creating in the people he meets the rather unsettling sensation that the man standing before them is famous, and they know him — if only they could remember what his name was. The mage gets preferential treatment. The best table in the restaurant. Front-of-the-line entry into the club without being on the guest list. He gets to misbehave — within reason — and given a lot more slack than a nobody would get. They indulge his eccentric behavior. He receives the perks of being famous without any of the trouble. Having said that, overuse of this spell can be risky.

Thereafter, whenever the mage’s Virtue is called into question, he must resist and deny that Virtue, or else risk losing some measure of his self-confidence and resolve (in the form of Willpower). To defy the “demon of virtue,” the willworker makes a reflexive and contested roll of his Gnosis + Mind versus his Resolve + Composure. If the Gnosis + Mind roll succeeds, the mage may act according to his Virtue, but regains no Willpower for doing so. If he fails, he must act directly counter to his Virtue, as well as losing a point of Willpower. Whether or not the mage succeeds in contesting the demon, however, it remains for the full duration of the spell, unless consciously banished.<p>Note that a willworker may cast this spell upon a willing subject with Mind 4, and upon an unwilling one with Mind 5.</p><p><i>Example: Logos, a Master of the Mind Arcanum, successfully casts Goetic Inversion upon Nero, another willworker. Nero is a Thyrsus, with no dots in Mind, and a Virtue of Fortitude. While he is still under the influence of Goetic Inversion, Nero’s Sleepwalker little sister becomes trapped inside a burning building. Normally, he would charge in, heedless of the danger or any harm to himself to rescue her, but the demon bound to Nero attempts to compel him to deny his Fortitude. Nero’s player rolls three dice (Nero’s Gnosis) versus six dice (the sum of his Resolve and Composure); the Resolve + Composure roll wins out and not only does Nero lose a point of Willpower, but he also flees the scene, abandoning his beloved sibling to her fate.</i></p><p>When the spell’s Duration expires, the demon seems to depart completely, leaving no trace that can be followed, whether magically or otherwise. In reality, it leaves the mind and spirit of its host, fleeing into Twilight, where it recuperates from the strain of passage and gathers its strength before finding an appropriate place from which to propagate its Influence.

If he wins, he gains Willpower as if his action had reflected the Vice (even though he didn’t actually act upon it). The demon is put down and banished (this spell must be cast again to gain the same effect). If the demon wins the contest, however, the mage must act out the Vice — and he doesn’t get Willpower for it. </p> <p>Example: A mage whose Vice is Gluttony is offered expensive champagne and all the drinks he wants. He knows his enemies are near, so he wants to keep his head clear and not indulge. The alcohol is tempting, however (he could sure use a Willpower point!). He had cast the “Goetic Struggle” spell earlier that hour, so decides to wrestle with the Goetic demon bound to him in hopes of reaping the benefit of his Vice without having to actually indulge it (and risking the consequences of becoming drunk). </p> <p>His player rolls Gnosis 3 + Mind 3 in a contested roll against his character’s own Resolve 2 and Composure 3. His Gnosis + Mind roll yields two successes, while the Resolve + Composure roll gets one. He wins the contest, so the mage gains one Willpower as if he had indulged his Gluttony, and he doesn’t have to touch a drink. If the Resolve + Composure (representing the demon) roll had won, he would have been forced to drink the alcohol offered and would not have recovered Willpower for it. </p><p>Casting this spell is an act of hubris, requiring a mage with a Wisdom higher than 4 dots to make a degeneration roll. </p>",

However, using this (or any other) spell to cause Sleepers to believe in magic more is one of the most serious crimes one of the Guardians of the Veil can commit, unless this is done inside of the strictures of an occult Labyrinth, where the Sleeper’s belief in a conspiracy theory or occult phenomena might be the key to redirecting that Sleeper into falsehoods.

In secret, she studied her fellow mages through scrying portals, calling their foremost conscious desires out of them, so they could be studied and the truth of the matter discerned. Lucia never found a lich, however, as none existed within the Consilium to find. Instead, she discovered that the rumor had been seeded by two Seers of the Throne who had quietly replaced Councilors, and that they were using the paranoia that the story engendered to gradually weaken any hope of concerted resistance when the time came for their allies to strike.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper’s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player’s descriptions of his character’s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage’s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character’s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character’s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage’s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start — 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim’s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim’s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned “home,” the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell “open” is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough — the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50’ of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",

Another focus of the festival is a key symbol that serves as the literal center of the activities.

Finally, at the completion of the casting, he pierces an image of the desired target (or another object which has sympathy to the target) with the dagger, then transfers the object to a burning brazier to be consumed.

The homunculus’ Mental Skills also cost one success per dot, with a limit of five dots per Skill. Social Skills obey the same limit but cost three successes per dot. Next the alchemist determines the degree of loyalty the homunculus feels toward its owner at the beginning of its career. (Although disloyal homunculi rarely become more favorably disposed toward their owners over time, initially steadfast individuals come to gradually rebel when subjected to continual mistreatment.)[TABLE1]<p>Loyal homunculi reserve their obedience for a single master, unless an affinity for others, most often fellow cabal members, is built into their personalities.</p>[TABLE2] Homunculi exhibit exaggerated, simplistic personalities. They generally model themselves either on the human donors of their organic tissue, if any, or on the alchemists who construct the homunculi’s personalities. They conduct themselves as one-dimensional parodies of their models, which can be disconcerting, especially to the persons they’re aping. By allocating five successes to the homunculus’ personality, the alchemist can specify another role model. The creature will still seem off-putting, but in a different, presumably more acceptable way. The proto must be left to spend significant time with the role model during personality formation. Spirits and ghosts, as well as living persons, can act as role models. The model may be physically present or represented by extensive audio or video recordings. It is therefore possible to imprint a homunculus with the persona of a public figure, celebrity or even a fictional character. When animated, this primal personality may be complicated by one or more derangements or Flaws (see below). The alchemist can prepare for this by choosing one derangement or Flaw for every five successes allocated for this purpose. If the homunculus does acquire derangements or Flaws, it gains those pre-selected by the alchemist, as opposed to merely random ones chosen by the Storyteller during animation.",

There exist certain interesting complications to this process, however. <p>First, the subject must be willing and desirous of sincere repentance. Of course, part and parcel with a failed degeneration check is a feeling of vindication in one’s improper actions, so this true longing for redemption is often easier said than done, and usually works better with either those who are, by nature, intensely virtuous or, conversely, those who have perceived an overarching pattern of wrongful behavior in themselves and wish to turn back from the path of hubris. Whatever the case, it is only a genuine commitment to self-betterment that empowers this spell’s soul- mending effects.</p><p>Second, the spell isn’t a guarantee; merely a chance. The subject receives the opportunity to re-roll the degeneration check, automatically subject to a +1 die bonus for sincere remorse. If this check succeeds, though, the subject regains the lost Wisdom without cost and loses any derangement gained <i>through that particular instance of degeneration</i>.

(In other words, no “going back” to the next instance of degeneration and trying to undo that one as well, thus enabling another willworker to potentially skyrocket in Wisdom.)</p> <p>Fourth, the Guardian must pay the piper, as it were, by accepting the burden of sin upon his own soul (and regardless of whether or not the subject actually succeeds in his “second chance” to feel regret for his prior actions). In the case of any act at least 2 dots <i>above</i> the Guardian’s present Wisdom score on the hierarchy of sins (see <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 79), this entails no degeneration check: his soul is simply too scarred already to suffer appreciably on account of this new burden. In the case of sins within one step of the Guardian’s present Wisdom score, in either direction, this involves a degeneration check for the Guardian, as normal, subject to all the customary consequences for either success or failure. In the event of a sin at least 2 dots <i>below</i> the Guardian’s present Wisdom score, this entails an <i>automatic</i> loss of Wisdom and the customary subsequent check to resist gaining a derangement.</p>",
