He must first have Mage Sight to be able to perceive the attacking spell. Like a dodge action, he can cast Counterspell against vulgar spells cast by another mage with a higher Initiative. (He cannot counter attacks with lower Initiatives if he has already performed an action in the turn. See “Dodge,” p. 156 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, for rules on how this circumvents the normal Initiative order for the turn.) A mage can even counter sympathetic spells cast directly at him (but not those cast at other targets), by sensing the sympathetic conduit being forged by the spell (again, he must have Mage Sight for this). </p><p>Successes are subtracted from the target spell’s Potency. If the target spell is left with no Potency, it is canceled entirely. If even a single point of Potency remains, the spell is applied against its target (at its reduced Potency). </p><p>A covert spell cannot normally be countered, since the defending mage must first identify its Arcanum components using the normal rules for doing so (see “Scrutinizing Spells,” p. 278). Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell. For example, to counter a conjunctional Mind 3 + Life 2 spell, a mage needs either Mind 1 or Life 1, but not both. If he does not have a proper Arcanum lore, he cannot counter the spell. Counterspell can be learned as a rote (use Occult Skill), but it must be learned separately for each Arcanum to which it applies.</p><p>A mage with two dots of Prime can instead use the “Counterspell Prime” spell, p. 222, to counter any spell, regardless of Arcanum.

Recording would seem at first to be a selfless or foolish thing to do, but orders are hungry for grimoires with which to teach young mages, and pay for them in favors. Also, certain Mind spells or creatures can take knowledge from a mage’s mind, leaving a void in its place. In case rotes are lost in this way, it’s good to have them “backed up” in a book.<p>The spell’s target number equals one success per Arcanum dot used in the rote to be recorded.

Additionally, the mage can cast a grimoire’s rotes even if he does not personally know the rotes, as long as he references the book during casting. Doing so requires one turn of reference, during which the mage can do nothing but read the book and move up to his Speed. In the following turn, he can cast the rote.

The spirit resembles a cross between the mage’s sword, a spirit common to the local Shadow and the mage herself.</p><p>A Dueling Pawn serves the mage that created it faithfully.

They may injure other spirits normally. Any Numina they might acquire that would allow them to inflict direct Health damage conforms to the above rule, instead. A shield Arcanum subtracts dice from attacking Pawns’ dice pools as if it was Armor, but unlike a standard duel, mages may move about the local Shadow to “physically” evade attacks, and gain the benefits of Defense where applicable.</p><p>As they are inextricably linked to the sorcerer’s will, Dueling Pawns can provide energy to stave off psychic defeat. As a reflexive action, a mage can divert Willpower damage that he suffered to the Resistance of a Pawn. If this knocks a Pawn’s Resistance to zero, the mage suffers any excess damage and the Pawn is destroyed. Mages cannot sacrifice Pawns to stave off Health injuries however, so deadly Shadow duels often end in a quick, lethal “checkmate.”</p><p>There are “Sanguine” versions of this spell that allow Dueling Pawns to inflict lethal or aggravated damage.

He must perform at least one oblation per month per dot rating of the Hallow (i.e., a 3-dot Hallow needs three oblations per month), based not on his Path’s preferences but on those of the Hallow, determined by its resonance. A resonance of pain or fear might require oblations featuring torture, maiming or death. Tranquility resonance might need meditative oblations or the tending of a garden within the Hallow’s vicinity.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper’s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player’s descriptions of his character’s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage’s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character’s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character’s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage’s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start — 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim’s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim’s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned “home,” the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell “open” is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough — the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50’ of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",

The tulpa possesses a Willpower score (the sum of Resolve and Composure as normal) and self-awareness, no matter how rudimentary.

The being dissolves when the spell expires. Unless the tulpa created is specifically designed to accept the inevitability of its own demise without emotional trauma, a Wisdom degeneration roll might be required for the caster (unless he has Wisdom 2 or lower). The mage could, however, recast this spell before the previous one expires, giving the tulpa a new Duration. Note that this is an exception to the normal rules for spell control.

Each dot of a Hallow is considered a separate extended roll and requires 10 successes to destroy. The Mana cost of the spell may be paid throughout the casting, rather than all at once. To fully destroy a Hallow, the mage must continue his work uninterrupted until the rating of the Hallow is reduced to zero. Once a Hallow is reduced to zero dots, it is considered destroyed. The backlash of suppressed magical energy forms a “Dead Zone” (see p. 230 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>) with the original rating of the Hallow acting as the number of successes gained to determine radius and volume. Until a Hallow is reduced to zero dots, treat the Hallow as being subjected to a “Suppress Hallow” spell (see p. 229 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>).<p>The casting of this spell creates a powerful clash in magic as the mage strives to pit himself against the natural magic of the Hallow. The visible results of this struggle can manifest themselves as violent storms, rains of frogs, glowing bands of light in the sky (similar to the aurora borealis) or anything else the Storyteller can devise. Mages attempting to destroy powerful Hallows are advised to seek help and cast this spell as a group ritual (see p. 129 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>) to increase their chances of success.</p>",
