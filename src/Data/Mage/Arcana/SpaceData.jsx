He must first have Mage Sight to be able to perceive the attacking spell. Like a dodge action, he can cast Counterspell against vulgar spells cast by another mage with a higher Initiative. (He cannot counter attacks with lower Initiatives if he has already performed an action in the turn. See “Dodge,” p. 156 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, for rules on how this circumvents the normal Initiative order for the turn.) A mage can even counter sympathetic spells cast directly at him (but not those cast at other targets), by sensing the sympathetic conduit being forged by the spell (again, he must have Mage Sight for this). </p><p>Successes are subtracted from the target spell’s Potency. If the target spell is left with no Potency, it is canceled entirely. If even a single point of Potency remains, the spell is applied against its target (at its reduced Potency). </p><p>A covert spell cannot normally be countered, since the defending mage must first identify its Arcanum components using the normal rules for doing so (see “Scrutinizing Spells,” p. 278). Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell. For example, to counter a conjunctional Mind 3 + Life 2 spell, a mage needs either Mind 1 or Life 1, but not both. If he does not have a proper Arcanum lore, he cannot counter the spell. Counterspell can be learned as a rote (use Occult Skill), but it must be learned separately for each Arcanum to which it applies.</p><p>A mage with two dots of Prime can instead use the “Counterspell Prime” spell, p. 222, to counter any spell, regardless of Arcanum.

        "DescrizioneMiddle": "The mage must fashion a summoning circle, usually sing runes and High Speech glyphs appropriate not only to the Arcanum he is using, but to the intended purpose of the summoning. The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper’s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player’s descriptions of his character’s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage’s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character’s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character’s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage’s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start — 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim’s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim’s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned “home,” the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell “open” is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough — the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50’ of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",

He can also combine this spell with a Ward during casting (see “Combining Spell”, <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 128).<p>When combined with another spell (which can be provided by a separate caster), this gives the Ward offensive capabilities. For instance, it could be combined with “Evil Eye” (<b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 151) to cause those who passed through it to suffer penalties per that spell.</p><p>A Ward altered in this manner uses the casting pool for the supplementary spell when it activates. The Wall has one charge of this spell, but additional charges may be applied without additional rolls if done at the time of casting, at a cost of one Mana each (in addition to the normal Mana cost for that spell).

Bob survives the assault and decides to Dispel the Ward/Walls combined spell. After a few minutes of analyzing the spells, he chooses to go after the Walls portion of the spell.
