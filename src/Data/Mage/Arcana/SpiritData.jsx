He must first have Mage Sight to be able to perceive the attacking spell. Like a dodge action, he can cast Counterspell against vulgar spells cast by another mage with a higher Initiative. (He cannot counter attacks with lower Initiatives if he has already performed an action in the turn. See “Dodge,” p. 156 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, for rules on how this circumvents the normal Initiative order for the turn.) A mage can even counter sympathetic spells cast directly at him (but not those cast at other targets), by sensing the sympathetic conduit being forged by the spell (again, he must have Mage Sight for this). </p><p>Successes are subtracted from the target spell’s Potency. If the target spell is left with no Potency, it is canceled entirely. If even a single point of Potency remains, the spell is applied against its target (at its reduced Potency). </p><p>A covert spell cannot normally be countered, since the defending mage must first identify its Arcanum components using the normal rules for doing so (see “Scrutinizing Spells,” p. 278). Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell. For example, to counter a conjunctional Mind 3 + Life 2 spell, a mage needs either Mind 1 or Life 1, but not both. If he does not have a proper Arcanum lore, he cannot counter the spell. Counterspell can be learned as a rote (use Occult Skill), but it must be learned separately for each Arcanum to which it applies.</p><p>A mage with two dots of Prime can instead use the “Counterspell Prime” spell, p. 222, to counter any spell, regardless of Arcanum.

First, the Templar creates the sign of the Holy Cross on the ground where he wishes to commune with the angel — the cross in the circle serves as a sort of beacon to the angel in question. Next, the Templar speaks the name of the angel after it has been encoded as a cipher. The more important the “messenger,” the more elaborate the cipher must be. Finally, the Templar makes the hand-sign of the Baphomet when the angel arrives, proving to the angel that he is worthy of witnessing the light of God.<p>The Templar casting this spell makes a single call to a single, specific “messenger” angel (whose name he may have procured from any number of sources, liturgical or lay, but it must be the angel’s true name). The angel who heeds the call (if the spell is successful) is from the loftier regions of the Shadow Realm but has a singular connection to the Aether, or “Heaven” as the Templar understands it. Obviously, the “angel” is not from the Aether proper, but is savvy to what has occurred there in an up-to-date sense. In the communion with the angel, the Templar may ask the angel any questions that he wishes, and the angel responds with whatever information is salient.</p><p>Of course, mere men surely cannot grasp the full import of what occurs in the Realms Supernal, and the angel’s answers may seem obtuse, incomprehensible, or chaotic. As well, the angel might simply deem the answer to a given question as one the Templar’s mind cannot possibly understand, and may deliberately occlude or withhold information (though it will never lie outright). “What does God look like?” is not a viable question for this spell to answer, nor is “What is the meaning of life?” In response to this first question, the angel might loose a torrent of incomprehensible Enochian syllables, answering the question honestly, but in the language only the angels can understand. The second question might yield an almost rhetorical response, such as, “To live in righteous imitation of Christ.” The angels will not be fooled by vain men’s attempts to divine the secrets of heaven.</p><p>Information that may be legitimately gleaned is information that the angel believes men have the context to understand. For example, “Is God angry that we seek the Ten Commandments” is a question that would receive a concise answer, while “How does God feel about our quest for the Ten Commandments” would elicit either an answer incomprehensible to the Templar or a simple rebuff that “It is beyond your capacity to know.”</p><p>The answers asked of the angels need not always concern the loftier realms. “Is the Temple Mount the true site of the Temple of Solomon?” is a fine question to ask (the answer to which depends upon the individual chronicle). So is “Where have the Templars stored their treasures?” Indeed, so is, “Where are my car keys?” but such a flippant question may well serve to stoke the ire of the angel, and the anger of angels isn’t something any mortal is likely to emerge from unchanged. To this end, it’s worth noting that summoning the angel in no way offers any protection from it, should its divine graces be mocked, challenged, or denigrated.</p>",

Of course, Simon Magus met his end after challenging God’s supremacy, but the Templars are certainly capable of learning from the mistakes of others.<p>Some Templars have taken it upon themselves to learn the celestial speech of the angels, potentially in hopes of tricking the angels to answer their questions with a language they assume the mortals not to comprehend. Again, the angels aren’t so simple as this. If an angel suspects a man might have learned the divine tongue, it might simply respond that the answer to a particularly dire question isn’t for men to know. And again, attempts at fooling the angels rarely work out well for the would-be trickster.</p><p>(Of course, that begs the question as to whether a man might even learn the Enochian language, where he’d learn it, and to what end. The occultists John Dee and Edward Kelley claimed to know the speech of Angels, but neither of them is associated with the Templar tradition.)</p>",

The orishas demand their tribute — many of them try to take bites of the raw flesh of the ritual sacrifice, and all must have their special foods and items (see Foci), or else they depart and the spell ends.</p><p>While the mage is being possessed, the orisha speaks and acts through him. The other santeros present can ask the orisha for advice or intercession. If any are Awakened, they can ask the orisha for magical understanding (this can be used to justify an increase in Gnosis or Arcana ratings), even learning rotes from the orisha. Occasionally, a mage channels one of the warlike orishas (Changó, Oggún, Elegguá, Ochosi, or Oyá) to help him fight in an upcoming battle.</p><p>The game effects of this possession vary depending on the Storyteller’s decision of what the orishas are and what role they fulfill in the chronicle. In general, this spell allows an effect similar to Coaxing the Spirits (Spirit 1), but with farther-reaching effects. The mage receives a number of bonus dice to a given task based on how satisfied the orisha is with the sacrifice, the items offered to it, and the bembe the mage performed (the Storyteller should take all of this into consideration and then make a roll for the player, probably Manipulation + Socialize, and use the successes for the bonus dice). These dice can be used on any roll that the task involves, but the player does not know how many he has to work with (just as the mage doesn’t know how far the orisha’s influence will carry him). At some point, the capricious orisha’s attention fades, and the mage is on his own again.</p>",

In addition, a Sleeper’s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player’s descriptions of his character’s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage’s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character’s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character’s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage’s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start — 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim’s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim’s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned “home,” the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell “open” is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough — the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50’ of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",

Honey was often added for flavor, and the modern version has it, as well. Some speculate that the entheogen of the brew came from empurpled barley, whose color was granted by the psychoactive ergot fungus that grew upon it. Others believe it the combination of the toxic mint and the fermentation of the brew contributed toward visions.</p><p>Here, modern participants of this ritual add their own hallucinogen – most prefer to add something natural (mushrooms, extract of ayahuasca, peyote), but some will add synthetics like LSD or lab-DMT to the brew.</p><p>The drink provides the first focus of the rote, and to a point, the hallucinogen in the drink is the second focus. Participants must gulp, not sip, the brew. The third focus is a copy of one of Homer’s books: likely The Iliad or The Odyssey, though the anonymous (but oft-attributed to him) Homeric Hymns work just as well. The caster must read from random passages from the text. The nature of the passages matters little. The simple repetition of these ancient words is believed to form a conduit between past, present and future through which the gods can travel.</p><p>(Note that some mages set a conditional duration upon this spell for the sake of safety. That condition is met when the Homeric text is closed. With the clap of the book’s closing, the “god” is banished.)</p><p>Note that this rote does not have a condition of environment (it can be performed anywhere, whether in the middle of a circle of stones or in a dark attic strewn with old toys), but it does have a temporal condition. It must be performed at dawn or dusk; at any other time, the rote fails. Improvised casting has no such restrictions.</p>",

A spirit’s suitability depends on what the mage wants the fetish to do. If he wants to shoot fiery arrows at his enemies or simply make a portable heater, he needs a fire spirit. Binding a water spirit does allow him to ignite his arrows or warm him on cold nights. Finding an appropriate subject often involves researching a spirit to make sure it can do what the mage wants — or that it can do what it says it can. Study usually involves an occult library or past training on the subject. If the Storyteller feels it necessary, he can require an Intelligence + Academics or Occult roll for the mage to properly identify a suitable spirit. The spirit releases its Numina only upon the fetish’s activation; it sleeps the rest of the time. The user must request or command the spirit to act whenever he seeks its power.
