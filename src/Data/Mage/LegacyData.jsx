        "descrizione": " <div>In seeking to grasp the higher order of the Supernal World, many mages look beyond the artificial reality constructed and maintained by mankind, toward the world of nature. While others leaf through dusty tomes or gaze into the smooth, polished surfaces of mirrors or glass balls in their secluded sanctums, there are those willing to step outside and draw knowledge and power from a greater world not of their own making. They read their incantations and prophecies in the stir of branches in the wind and the fall of leaves. They draw power and strength from the green, growing world. </div> <div>There is a secret language in nature, and from those who are able to read it nothing in the Fallen World may be hidden, for all things are interconnected and everything is reflected in everything else. Nature displays its treasures for all to see, but unfolds in ways that few can ever fully comprehend, changeless only in its ever-changing evolutions, devolutions and revolutions. The diligent mage may divine the intricate syntax and grandiose grammar of this secret language, glimpsing even deeper secrets in the Mists that enshroud mysteries beyond mortal comprehension. </div> <div>Most would halt or turn back, but some press on into this nature beyond nature, this “supernature,” if you will. In the Mists can be found the implicit order from which the visible world grows, the sleeping giants whose bodies are the land, whose breath is the wind, of whose voices the thunder is but an echo. Here is where the faces of nymphs shine through flower and fruit and leaf, where the dances of sylphs trace breeze and gale, where gnomes churn away at the molten heart of the mountain. This is where magic is born, and even the mightiest mage must tread carefully or not at all. </div>  <div>The Walker in Mists reaches beyond the seen into the unseen, tapping magic at the source of all life as was done in times long forgot. Other mages look within themselves, or up at distant heavens, but the Walker actually travels in the world seeking realms of pure enchantment. He knows the deep caverns of the earth where dragons yet sleep, and what ancient invisible roads lead to the fae countries. </div>  <div>It was the Walker in Mists who first taught mankind to mark the trails it followed and to recognize landmarks that could lead unerringly from region to region. Rather than following seasonal growth or available game, mankind could choose its own path to its destiny. In short, he taught us not simply to migrate, but to actually travel. To the more settled folk he gave games of chance — the vagaries of which teach, in miniature, the mysteries of fate and destiny — that they too might experience the adventure of the unknown. </div> <div>But with the spread of civilization, mankind forgot the wisdom of the Walker, taking his gifts for granted and detaching itself from the rhythms and cycles of the natural world. Even his games of chance — once used to divine the very will of the gods themselves — degenerated into a competitive orgy of materialistic greed, attracting crime and corruption. As broad, well-traveled roads carved up the wilderness and creased the face of the earth, the Walker found it increasingly necessary to rely upon ley lines to guide him invisibly through the Mists from grove to lake to mountain as he visited the few remaining sacred sites. In modern times, he is completely marginalized, a loner patrolling the fringes of the overdeveloped world. </div>",

        "appearance": "While Walkers seem to occupy the extremes of the physiognomic spectrum, most tend toward lean physiques, better suited for constant travel, and often have tanned skin from the time spent outdoors (although, oddly, with generally smooth complexions). Most favor simple functional clothing when on the road, but all invariably seem to exhibit some natural flamboyance, howsoever understated, that usually blends bohemian and hippie fashions with styles from older historical periods: headbands and armbands, sashes instead of belts, robes or kilts instead of trousers.",
        "background": "Inheritors of the Walking Legacy may emerge from nearly any socioeconomic demographic, although the super-rich seldom manage to take on the risks of this lifestyle. Those who travel frequently out of necessity or vocation are more likely to encounter a Walker, while those of an imaginative or artistic bent are more likely to appreciate a Walker’s enchantments and seek to learn about the wonders he conjures. The subculture of gambling has provided fertile ground for this Legacy, but all Walkers unanimously abhor the commercialism that has degraded their once-sacred pastime.",
        "organizzation": "Every Walker in the Mists is accustomed to the life of the solitary nomad. Although all destinies are shared, all paths leading to destiny are separate. Even teacher and student must part ways eventually. The crossing of paths, therefore, is a momentous occasion inaugurated by lengthy introductions recounting each Walker’s origins and travels, followed by a kind of singing-game in which each takes turns reciting his tutorial lineage until a common spiritual ancestor is found. After that, any food, provisions or contraband carried by each is pooled and shared. Then there may be a general discussion of the omens and portents of the current age, followed by another singing-game in which travel itineraries are compared so that warnings can be given about possible past and future destinations, with particular emphasis on immediate dangers. (This exchange is in accordance with the old bardic line, “When two meet, each is about to go where the other has just been.”) In times of impending crisis or necessary haste, all but the final phase of the ceremony may be dispensed with until some later date when convenience allows. The crossing of paths is rare, and even rarer when paths intertwine so that bands of Walkers take to the Mists. Walker groups, notoriously short-lived, are the stuff of legend, unheard of in the modern day. Rumors sometimes circulate of Walker families who tend to the world’s dwindling virgin wildernesses and sacred sites.",

Doing so allows him to scry into distant places as if he were using the “Scrying” spell, p. 235. He must scry through the medium of plant life — trees, flowers, bushes or even grass. As long as there is some form of plant life in the place he wishes to scry, the mage can see there. To peer into the Mists and spy the desired location (i.e., to open a scrying window), an instant action is performed and Wits + Survival + Space is rolled, modified by the sympathetic distance (see pp. 114-115). After he has established the window, a reflexive action is required to view through it.",

He can do this only amidst nature, where at least one green shoot grows from the earth. One Willpower point must be spent to summon the Mists if green space is lacking.

This ability is like the “Portal” spell, p. 238, although it is an instant action. The effect’s duration, however, is only for the turn in which it is activated and the subsequent turn (in which the mage and/or his friends presumably step onto the Mist path and step out at their destination). To keep it open longer, the mage must concentrate (as with any concentration-based spell; see p. 119). He can only open a path at and travel to a place with some form of plant life (even a small patch of grass is acceptable). Others can join him on his journey through the Mists: One person of Size 5 or less can pass through the portal per turn; larger people can spend two turns squeezing through. An instant action is performed to activate this power, and Composure + Survival + Space is rolled to determine success (modified by the sympathetic distance of the destination).",

He performs an instant action and can ask one question about a subject’s possible future (what might happen rather than what will happen) per Time dot. This power can be used concerning the same target only once every 24 hours."

        "descrizione": " <div>Among the most enigmatic of Legacies is the Subtle Ones, mages who “do without doing,” who are “in the world but not of it.” Look for them and they are gone. Many doubt their very existence, but those who understand their ways can detect their influence throughout the world. Their names are not recorded by history, but much of history was written by them. Their faces may not be found upon monumental statuary, but most monuments are carved according to proportions devised by a Subtle hand. Though they heed no bounds and move by routes unknown, it is their pen that dictates where roads and borders are laid. To some they are skulking villains who dare not show their faces. To others they are the secret chiefs of the great conspiracy that brings the world to order. To themselves, they are simply the Subtle Ones, or the Ahl-i-Batin, the “People of the Inner Truth” who serve as the culture-bearers of civilization — not by bringing the world to order, but by bringing order to the world. </div> <div>Batini magic utilizes sacred geometry to open the mind to divine reality. By studying the complexities of spatial relationships and proportionality, the soul can compose itself to harmonize with the world, and so compose the world. Subtle lore traces itself back to the architects and city planners of Atlantis, for whom sociology was no mere science but a magical art. They believed that a harmonious society that both sustains and fulfills all its members could be achieved through proper patterning of the space it occupies, engendering proper patterns of behavior in occupants. This social engineering concerned itself with everything from broad geographical plans to the minutiae of detail in art, music and literature. Every aspect of culture could be made to reflect — and so teach and encourage — greater social harmony. </div> <div>The Subtle Ones exerted substantial influence in all the great civilizations of the world up through the European Renaissance until their power, obtained largely through the work of agents placed within major political and religious institutions, waned as secular society waxed. At present, the Subtle Ones are too few and scattered to enact any of their plans on a large scale, but have learned to keep themselves insinuated into the ever-changing administrations of modern politics, mostly by seizing posts within the intelligence community. They also maintain a constant presence in the worlds of art, fashion, communication and education. From these positions they can control (or at least influence to some nominal degree) the excesses and vicissitudes of society at large. </div> <div>Because the Subtle Ones are so arcane and secretive about themselves, their motives are often called into question by other mages. Their hand has been discerned in innumerable plots and intrigues throughout history, most notably in the Order of Assassins, a deviant sect of Ishmaelite Islam. From its network of impregnable mountaintop fortresses, this group dispatched highly trained operatives to extend its influence, from fanatically suicidal hit men to skilled and patient deep-cover agents. Some consider this sect to be the Subtle Ones’ crowning achievement, a spiritually inclined utopian society sustaining itself in the midst of a hostile social climate with a minimum of military force. Others see the Assassins as the very worst of the Subtle Ones’ work — secluded and insular, using murder as a tool to separate themselves from the outside world for an autocratic leader who claims overweening spiritual authority while commanding his mind-slaves to kill themselves as a demonstration of his power. The final words of the sect’s founder, the legendary Old Man of the Mountain, Hassan-i-Sabbah — “Nothing is true, everything is permitted!” — is often taken to indicate the deeply amoral identity of this Legacy. </div> <div>In fact, the Subtle Ones do not hesitate to engage in acts that would be condemned by most spiritual traditions. The Ahl-i-Batin also employ a number of ascetic practices taken to potentially dangerous extremes, including fasting, flagellation and self-mutilation. Their long history of brainwashing, mind control and social manipulation is cause for concern as well. Among their other disciplines, they cultivate the way of the unseen assassin, and are not above using violence or a convincing threat of violence to achieve their aims. Thus, they can be said to wield considerable temporal power. The Subtle Ones do not consider themselves to be the masters of the world, but merely the goad-servants of human evolution, scourging mankind to drive it up the spiritual slope toward an eventual postulated universal Awakening. </div> <div>As to when this will occur, the Legacy presents no clear answer. At present, the prevailing view is that too many secrets have been discovered (or leaked) to the Sleepers too soon, granting humanity a capacity for destruction in disproportionate excess to its current degree of moral development. This course presents a danger to the world as a whole, mages included, and so must be curbed by whatever means necessary. </div>",

        "appearance": "The Subtle Ones have made a science of anonymity and tend to blend into their surroundings, taking on local dress and customs with great facility, able to disappear instantly into a crowd or traffic. Inheritors of this Legacy are noted — if identified at all — for their quiet and reserved demeanor, as well as for their piercing gaze",
        "background": "The historical influence of the Subtle Ones was most strongly expressed among various esoteric traditions of the Middle East — gnosticism, qabalism, Sufism — and so many of its most enlightened members come from those traditions. Most of the terminology found in this Legacy is of Arabic or Persian derivation. The operations of the Subtle Ones are global in scope and their methodology is highly eclectic, so that Subtle Ones can be found almost anywhere. (Actually, it might be more correct to say that Subtle Ones are in place almost anywhere in the world. Whether they can actually be found is another matter.)",
        "organizzation": "Once his apprenticeship has concluded, the Subtle One seldom makes direct contact with other inheritors of his Legacy. Groups do sometimes form for a particular purpose, though; these are tightly knit and highly insular cells so extravagantly surreptitious that each member may not even know the identities of the others. Meetings are conducted with faces veiled and bodies cloaked. Speech never rises above a whisper, and separate routes are taken for entrances and exits. One might ask, with such a pall of secrecy, how the Ahl-i-Batin are able to maintain communications, much less a global conspiracy. The “master plan” of the Atlantean social engineers is reiterated throughout Batini lore, such that no inheritor is left without a thorough understanding of the role he is to play in the process of human evolution. This is not to imply that a Subtle One is merely a cog in a great machine, following a preprogrammed pattern. On the contrary, creativity and originality are prized and encouraged both within the Legacy and in the world at large. <div>The local details of the collective plan vary from region to region, even from neighborhood to neighborhood in large cities, so facets must be communicated to newcomers. A Subtle One is trained to read broad cultural patterns — power structures, economic concerns, religious beliefs, artistic trends and personal tendencies — into styles of dress, art, building and music. Simply by glancing at any street corner or marketplace, he can divine any number of particulars about his surroundings. For example, the seemingly innocuous advertisements for shaving cream on local billboards might clue him in about a new religious fundamentalism that’s taking hold in the community, even though it’s not yet evident in anyone’s behavior. While the connection between shaving cream and fundamentalism would never occur to a casual observer, the subtle strands of unconscious belief and desire represented by the two forces are obvious to the Subtle One observer, allowing him to make intuitive leaps of understanding that are irrational or mystifying to others. </div>  <div>Furthermore, Batini are likely to have encoded their own innovations into the social fabric. Visitors might read specific messages and even elaborate reports in such ubiquitous details as an architectural ornament, a hemline border stitch, the layout of streets or the melody of a popular folk tune. </div>",

        "descrizione": " <div>Since the dawn of civilization, mankind has dreamed of creating wealth from worthless matter. Such a dream can be made real, mankind found, but only through hard work and a bit of luck. A lump of stone or wood can, through carving, grinding or knapping, be made into an object that is useful, beautiful or both. Patience and toil can be applied to a patch of dirt to cause crops to spring up or livestock to increase and grow strong. Those willing to sacrifice their time and effort in this way often seem to feel that basing their lifestyle on such activity yields not only material wealth but also endows the soul with extended qualities of utility and beauty. </div>  <div>Not everyone was willing to put forth such effort, though, so some devised shortcuts to wealth, claiming credit for the work of others or even claiming the product of that work for themselves. They divorced the notion of “wealth” from the material benefits of work, reducing riches to a system of artificial value placed upon rare metals or gems (and later to printed scraps of paper and then to glowing numbers on a monitor screen). The actual work of enriching life was denigrated as a lowly occupation and the soulcraft it engendered dismissed as fantasy by those unwilling to engage in it. Getting something for nothing only leaves one wanting more. Empty wealth, like food without nutrients, can be addictive, expanding the vacuum it was intended to fulfill. </div>  <div>Into such a vacuous society there inevitably resurfaced distorted legends that told of how the mages of old learned the secret of tuning lead into gold, dirt into money, shit into Shinola. With the legends came charlatans, those who claimed to know the trick of getting something for nothing, who were sought out by kings with vacuous coffers, who fleeced their patrons by wrapping their lead ingots in polished brass foil and slipped out of the palace by night with their own empty wealth jingling in their purses. So the legends fell into disrepute (but without ever disappearing entirely) while the quest for empty wealth continued. The truth behind those legends would shock the royal addicts who heard them. Indeed, the mages of Atlantis had learned the “trick” of transmuting one substance into another, but it was only an incidental side effect of their real work. Their labors were not ultimately directed toward the external material world, but inward. Like land, wood or stone, the human soul can be cultivated and shaped, they found, transformed into something both greater and finer than what it might otherwise be. The “lead” that they operated upon was themselves, and the “gold” that they created was themselves. </div>  <div>This is not to say that their “alchemy” was a purely contemplative practice, a type of meditation cloaked in a physical metaphor. The image of the secluded chamber with its kiln and clutter of alembic, retort and crucible is factually accurate. Experimentation in the material plane was as much a part of their practice as spiritual discipline. Engaging in a physical craft with an appropriate mindset of self-observation can synchronize changes in both the inner and outer worlds. This Legacy teaches that true understanding is best reached by mirroring the inner process with the outer. </div>  <div>Just as matter can be shaped by heat and cold, by hammer’s blow and chisel’s cut, so too can the soul be shaped by pleasure and pain, by feeling and thought. Emotional baggage or faulty modes of thought can be trimmed away and desirable qualities such as honesty and compassion may be added to the alloy mixture in the crucible of the soul. Imperfection can be burned off, boiled out or frozen and chipped away. The soul’s purest essence may be distilled out of the woes and trauma that weigh it down, leaving it free to become that which is rarer and more precious than gold — the fulfilling life of the complete person. </div>  <div>Inheritors of this Legacy are known as the “Uncrowned Kings,” a term that most outsiders take to refer to the age of the charlatans, when the rulers of the world could be led by their vacuous desires and anyone who knew those desires could easily become a true “power behind the throne.” But a more esoteric meaning is hidden in the name. Having perfected the technique of crafting their own souls, the Uncrowned could truly claim to be “self-made men,” masters of their own souls. Their “royalty” is based, not upon primogenitore or the hoarding of hollow wealth, but upon the noble qualities that they have cultivated within themselves. They do not rule over nations, but over themselves to a degree that “common” folk can scarcely imagine. </div>  <div>The qualifier “Uncrowned” is equally significant on an esoteric level, beyond the fact that they do not openly display their unique nobility. The adornment of precious metals and gems is at once a metaphoric image connoting inner nobility and personal power, a reference to the physical transmutations that this Legacy practices. The title is also an oblique suggestion of the halo found in religious iconography denoting a brilliance or radiance of consciousness so bright that it shines directly through the skull (normally visible to those with aura perception but sometimes accessible to Sleepers in a religious context). But these Kings are emphatically Uncrowned, eschewing not only the lauds of their peers, but also the empty wealth that they are capable of creating. </div>",

Intelligence + Crafts is rolled, and the time per roll is at least half an hour, but it can be longer depending on the craft involved. If a month passes without him purifying his soul through the meditative process of labor, he loses his attainments until he succeeds in his calling. Whenever a mage uses the 2nd or 3rd Uncrowned attainment, his head is wreathed in a shining halo, the sign of his alchemically purified soul. The halo can be seen only by mages or other supernatural beings using an aura-perception power (such as a Mind or Prime spell or a vampire’s Auspex Discipline).

        "descrizione": " <div>Often upon Awakening, fledgling mages turn dismissive of the mundane material world. Having penetrated the veil of lies and illusion, they stand upon the threshold of a whole new world so dazzling that they tend to forget their previous mode of existence. They reckon that the old rules no longer apply to them. Admitted into a new confraternity of like souls, they draw away from their families and friends, who cannot understand their new vision and abilities. Now able to transcend the gross limitations of matter and energy, some even neglect their own corporeal bodies, regarding them as a mere hindrances, husks to be discarded once their usefulness has ended. While there is some truth to this way of thinking, it is not a whole truth. It is a road that leads to dissolution and disembodiment. </div>  <div>The Perfected Adepts stand as a warning sign upon that road, reminding all mages where they came from and what their ultimate goal is, or should be. Their presence signifies a return to the source, a remembrance that all mages are still human beings — they are born, live their lives and die. If magic cannot be made to enrich and fulfill that process, then it is not magic but delusion. The Adepts teach that before one can truly transcend the limitations of being human, one must learn what the true limitations of humanity are. Furthermore, they teach that the wisdom gained through transcendence must be brought back to humanity, so as to enable others to follow the same road. A human being is a work in progress, they hold. Awakening is not the completion of that work, but the opportunity for completion, for perfection. </div>  <div>And yet, the task of perfecting oneself cannot be accomplished while still entangled in the web of lies and illusion. Though the Adepts do not disdain or reject the affairs the material world, they do require a substantial removal in order to pursue their goals. Renunciation of worldly attachments or wealth is the first necessary step for disentangling oneself from the world. Adepts tend to retreat into hermitages or cloistered communities, both magical and mundane, in order to disconnect from influences that distract from self-observation and cultivation. They simplify their lives, shunning extraneous noise and clutter so that they can hear the murmurs of their innermost selves. </div>  <div>Once a suitable degree of quietude and simplification is attained, an Adept begins the process of perfection by concentrating upon the base from which his consciousness springs, his own physical body. With worldly concerns out of the way, the first thing that the Adept may notice are the noises and sensations that come from within his corporeal rame. True calm and peace of mind are not possible while the body exists in a state of discomfort or disease, or even less than optimal health. A strict regimen of adjusted diet and exercise must be undertaken to ensure that the body does not distract from the clarity of the mind. </div>  <div>The Perfected Adepts consider martial training to be the most effective type of physical exercise for their purposes. In addition to building strength and flexibility, the student is taught to focus mind and body to function as a unified whole. Besides enhancing the capability of the body, martial arts have a calming effect upon the mind by instilling knowledge and confidence to deal with direct physical threats. Discipline and perseverance, also necessary in magical training, are encouraged and honed. (Asian martial arts in particular incorporate esoteric elements such as focused meditation and occult physiology that perfectly complement the study of magic.) Most systematized fighting styles around the world include some ethical principles whereby practitioners are exhorted to aid and protect those of lesser ability, an ideal that the Adepts proudly espouse. </div>  <div>As the mind works at perfecting the body, it also learns to operate upon itself, gaining mastery over thought and emotion rather than being ruled by them. Just as the distractions of the outer world can be dispelled, just as the wants and urgings of the body can be quelled, so can the chatter and babble of the lower mind be silenced, leaving the soul free hear what it most needs to tell itself. Only when everything has fallen away can the innermost self be free to seek perfection by uniting the highest reality with the lowest. </div>  <div>To some this union might seem to be the ultimate goal, the reason for a mage’s existence. But for the Perfected Adepts, this is not the end of their work, but the beginning. Perfection is meaningless if it is static and removed from the world, so the Adept is obligated to return to the world and help others to find the way to inner peace. The Adept’s martial prowess makes him a natural champion and protector, but perfection is not bound to any one role. The patience and discipline that mark an Adept’s training make him suitable for a number of callings, from the most repetitive of mindless menial labor to the most arcane and convoluted of intellectual pursuits such as science or philosophy. In this way, the Perfected Adept brings perfection into an imperfect world, making himself an exemplar for others to follow and by which to measure themselves. </div>",

Before man chose to set himself apart from beasts and trees and rocks, they knew the truth: that the circle of life is broad enough to include all things “organic” and “inorganic,” that this great wheel turns easily from one form to another, that man and beast and tree and rock are one. </div>  <div>It was they who first took to the grazing-fields, to follow the comings and goings of the herds. And when they had learned the steps of the herddance and could sing the words of the herd-song, they put on themselves the skins of the herd-dress and slept in the cold and rain until they became part of the herd itself. It was they who first ran with the wolves and learned the worth of honesty when the wolves pointed toward unseen prey in hopes of sharing the kill. And it was they who stalked against the great cats and learned the value of deception, letting other hunters pass by in hopes of keeping the “lion’s share” of the kill for themselves. They it was who flew with the birds, crept with the vines and slept with the stones. </div>  <div>They went where others could not go and did what others could not do. They learned the lessons that life taught from every angle and brought their knowledge back to their tribes to teach the business of living. They sought wisdom to lead their tribes out of darkness and cold and hunger, and set mankind on a path that would eventually lead to civilization. But mankind mistook its new powers of stewardship over the land as mastery, and regarded the animals, plants and rocks only as resources to be plundered rather than as partners in the circle of life. In their hubris, they forgot the wisdom that they had taught and dismissed their utterances as backward superstition. </div>  <div>They who had sacrificed the semblance of their humanity for the greater good were now cast out. Ostracized and despised, they were relegated to the status of monsters and bogeymen used to frighten unruly children. The mighty warriors who had once donned hide and claw and fang in the service of their people were now cast in the role of bloodthirsty murderer. Those who lived by the old lore of leaf and stone were hunted down and torn to pieces or burned in public spectacle. The horns and hooves of the most sacred were denounced as emblems of evil. </div>  <div>All the oldest languages of the world once had a name for them, most now forgotten. In modern English, they are known as the Orphans of Proteus, for their metamorphosis ability. Some say they, not the Atlanteans, were the very first humans to Awaken, and some even go so far as to suggest that all other types of magic are derived from theirs. Whether that is true or not, many now consider them to be a dying breed. Marginalized by the encroachment of civilization, they are usually found only at the fringes of mage society. They engage in few formalities, and the kinship of spirit they share is something that is felt, unspoken, deep within their souls. </div>  <div>Inheritors of the Proteus Legacy can be unnerving, not only to other mages, but to those who know nothing of magic. Social customs and mores — at least, those of the modern civilized world — mean little to them, and they may at times break laws, cross boundaries or ignore table manners and dress codes without compunction. This is not to say that they are dumb brutes. Members may exhibit as much intelligence and compassion as any other sorcerer. They tend to be plainspoken, even rudely blunt, and act impulsively upon primal urges known only to them. For those who have experienced the non-human world directly, such phrases as “nature red in tooth and claw” or “the force that through the green fuse drives the flower” are no mere poetic conceits, but the very bedrock of reality. </div>",

        "descrizione": " <div>In the Dark Ages, when mages held more sway in the world and the orders waxed in power, great resources were spent in plumbing the most profound secrets of the earth. Sanctums swelled with students, vast libraries of lore were gathered, and expeditions were mounted to the most remote extremities of the globe. Mages journeyed to mist-shrouded mountaintops in legendary lands, deserted isles in uncharted latitudes, lost cities crumbling beneath waves of water, sand or jungle, and into the moldy vaults of rumor-haunted necropolises of antiquity. Some of those who pursued this last course dug too deep into the past and literally awoke the dead. </div>  <div>Even the most finely honed Awakened would be sorely pressed to resist the chilling intensity of an undying desire that has festered in darkness and hunger for centuries. These mages found that they had, willingly or not, taken on new instructors, keepers of profound knowledge and wielders of terrifying power, teachers who might have been human once, but were no longer. Masters with a particularly insatiable need. </div>  <div>Vampirism is a state of being that comes with fantastic potential, but it is nonetheless a curse. Young vampires do not always grasp the full import of this simple fact, but as the sunless decades of hunger pass, they learn that undying existence is not the same as eternal life. Raging against this fate, an obscure line of vampires called the Tremere encountered an entity from the Abyss and wrested from it certain secrets about the Supernal and Fallen Worlds. Using this forbidden knowledge, they formulated in their blood a way of circumventing their curse by stealing from the living the inner light that they themselves lacked. Through the drinking of blood, a Tremere could tap a victim’s soul, allowing him to live for a short time as if he were nearly human, walking in twilight (but not full daylight) and becoming sated by normal food rather than blood. The process desiccated the stolen soul, however, leaving its owner to wither away into a slow, witless death. The souls of normal humans proved too dim and murky to sustain the Tremere for more than a few days at best. The undead needed something much brighter and clearer. </div>  <div>They found what they needed in the Awakened souls of the mages who intruded into their lair, but the very brilliance they desired also ensured that their intended victims were not mere cattle to be seized and consumed with impunity. The mages had to be lured into the fold with intimations of ancient power and arcane lore. The vampires made good on their temptations, unveiling some of the deepest mysteries of vampiric lore. The mages eagerly took the bait, heedless of the cost that would be exacted from them. </div>  <div>In tapping the mages’ souls while they drank of their blood, the vampires discovered that their Abyssal lore had failed them. The blood burned in their veins with celestial fire and rendered their bodies to ash in mere moments, destroying every single one of them. But their damnation did not end with them. They passed on a part of their curse to their vessels, infecting the mages with the most virulent aspect of their unique Abyssal damnation. The mages, though not undead, had placed one foot firmly on the far side of the grave and found their souls eroding away into the great darkness beyond all light. The spiritual vacuum thus created eventually spread to their outward forms, consuming their bodies until some of them ceased to exist, or else wandered the earth as hungry ghosts. To fill their growing void, the survivors learned to steal the light from those who had it. They had become living vampires, stealers of souls. </div>  <div>At first, these sorcerers took the vampires’ name, Tremere, as a title to describe their condition: “Tremere-inflicted.” Other mages just called them the Tremere, and over time the lichs accepted this shorthand for themselves, although it is still used as an adjective: “Tremere lich.” </div>  <div>A mage must be voluntarily initiated into this Legacy by having his own soul severed by his teacher and replaced with someone else’s. The soul link between instructor and pupil transmits the lich curse once the new soul is attached. Usually, the master then attaches the pupil’s soul to himself, for Awakened souls last much longer than Sleeping souls. It is extremely rare for a young or even middle-aged mage to make this hideous choice. Usually, only those near the end of their natural life spans choose to become lichs in hopes that, by unnaturally extending their lives on a diet of souls, they might unlock the key to ascension and rise to the deathless lands of the Supernal World. </div>  <div>And yet, it is possible for a pupil to reverse course and restore his humanity before he has gone too far. If he can regain his own soul and reattach it (using spells, not Tremere attainments) before he raises his Gnosis above the amount of dots he had when he was first initiated into this Legacy, and then if he sacrifices a dot of Willpower, he loses all Tremere attainments and become fully ensouled again.

This is no mere initiatic hurdle to weed out the unworthy, but a very real danger to a mage’s psyche, for the Abyss is far from empty. Awash in its torrents, its darkness clings, permeating clothing, body and soul. The slightest misstep in the Abyss can so derange the enlightened that any illumination they transmit is tainted with madness. Thus do the Legacies collectively known as the Scelesti — the Accursed — come into being.</div><div>If the hordes of the Abyss can be said to have an agenda or motive, it would seem to be a desire to claim the Fallen World in lieu of the shining realms of the Supernal World that are closed to them. These entities, languishing in a kind of non-existence between the pure light of the Supernal and the gross matter of the Fallen World, seek to establish themselves in the latter. To accomplish this, an Abyssal entity must have some instrument through which to work its will in the material world. The Scelesti are such instruments. Unable to emerge in being by their own power alone, Abyssal beings must first make themselves known to an Awakened consciousness, who can then make their presence real in the Fallen World by writing the spirits’ unpronounceable names across the earth in letters of fear, suffering and disaster. </div><div>Mages who gaze too long into the Abyss fall prey to fascination and awe, their souls bound up in madness and obsession with the yawning chasms of unreason. Some might escape with psychic scars. Others fall prey to their own delusions and desires. Mistaking the vastness of the Abyss for a source of knowledge and strength, they abandon all sense and reason to lose themselves in endless chaos. Or they pledge themselves to the entities that lurk therein, and so consign their souls to oblivion. </div><div>Those who are able to retain enough of their identity to contain their madness find that the Abyss has power in and of itself, apart from the hordes of non-beings that haunt it. Some swim in a primordial ocean of chaosplasm, riding its currents and shaping it to their ends. Others are lost to the void, their inner light swallowed in darkness and silence. Still others may find twisted reflections of their Supernal ideals in delusions.</div> <div>Meanwhile, the new overlords of the corrupted mages goad them on with promises of worldly glory and opulence — once the Fallen World has fallen into their clutches, of course. Such a thing cannot be accomplished alone, however, so the immediate task of the Scelesti becomes that of luring other mages into their sway and bringing them to the brink of the Abyss.</div> <div>Being one of the Accursed has its advantages. In a corrupt world, the expert corrupter can rule. The Abyssal hordes are not without power, and grant portions of their might to a mage who can provide them with a foothold in the Fallen World. And there are legions of lesser entities, any of which may be dispatched to serve a Scelestus as slave, guardian or familiar.</div> <div>Damnation by this magical course is not specific to any Path. Inheritors of this Legacy may be found practicing anywhere in mage society, using arcane symbolism and hermetic secrecy to conceal their true nature from peers and the rest of the world. Sometimes when a Scelestus is discovered within an order, his entire tutorial lineage may be stricken from the order’s records if it cannot be determined at which point a teacher was corrupted.

Somehow, facing the terrors of the elements was eased by the nearness of others. </div><div>Imagine the sense of awe that filled the hearts of these early people when wise men and women arose who could command the lightning and still the thunder, who could bring gentle rains to parched lands and turn aside the flood waters, who could stop wildfires in their tracks and cause the killing blizzards to cease. These men and women, whether they were born into the tribes or came from distant lands — as the earliest ones claimed — held the lives of entire tribes in their hands. Because of these wise ones’ powers, they were both honored and feared; they were called weather witches, wise men or women, rain dancers or many other names. They called themselves Storm Keepers, for they learned to master the storms within themselves as well as the storms that came from the play of elements within and around the earth.</div><div>Now the tribes felt that they were not entirely at the mercy of storms, floods, wildfires and other natural upheavals. Their Storm Keepers could not always assuage the powers that sent these elemental visitations, but the Storm Keepers could intercede and, sometimes, they could change a raging storm into a gentle rain or an all-consuming wildfire into a beneficial burn that purged part of the land and allowed new growth to rise in place of the old. This worker of weather magic stood between them and the unknown, between the tribe and the wrath of the gods. </div><div>The Storm Keeper is more than a bringer of rain or an ender of floods. She is more than a predictor of weather. In essence, she has made herself one with the pulse of the world so that she understands on a deep, molecular level the processes and the give-and-take that cause the phenomenon of weather. She knows when stopping a storm will truly save a village from floods or when it will only deflect the waters so that they cause greater damage elsewhere. She understands the balance of nature and the destiny of those who live in the natural world. Storm Keepers gradually shared their weather lore with individuals who seemed able to understand it. They became great teachers of balance and interrelatedness. In the old world, they were sometimes thought of as druids. In the Americas, they were called rain dancers, for their intricate tracing of patterns and calls to the Heavens often resulted in an answer from the formerly empty skies. They used their knowledge of how fate and time affected the forces of nature to analyze when it was best to tamper with the movement of wind and water and when doing so would only bring disaster later.</div><div>Because Storm Keepers sometimes withheld their power, men and women sometimes resented these gifted ones. When other people came along with “scientific” explanations of weather patterns, the Storm Keepers were shunted to the sidelines in favor of “weathermen” who could only predict the weather (and then with varying degrees of accuracy). Soon, Storm Keepers became the stuff of legend. Modern men and women even questioned whether or not Storm Keepers truly existed.</div><div>Today, Storm Keepers remain on the sidelines. In some parts of the world, where shamanic rituals and weather calling still take place, the Storm Keeper enjoys a remnant of the old honor and awe. For the most part, however, these weather witches content themselves with keeping their fingers on the pulse of the universe, staving off the worst of disasters when it seems possible, and watching the futility of mere knowledge to affect the movement of air and water across the face of the world. Science may explain weather, but so far science can do little to change weather or control it.</div>",

Their eyes are frequently surrounded by tiny lines similar to laugh lines but caused by constant squinting to look into the sun or to fight snow blindness. Hair is usually worn short or else it retains a tousled, windblown look even on calm, windless days. In short, Storm Keepers have a literally “weathered” look. They tend to dress for the outdoors, even when wearing formal or “dress” clothes, and they are never without appropriate weather gear. Many female Storm Keepers enjoy wearing jewelry that is sensitive to even the slightest of breezes, such as long, dangling earrings or feathery hairpieces.

Some Storm Keepers still assign themselves to the remaining tribal people in the world, usually in places such as the Amazon, or the Congo, or the Australian outback or the Alaskan wilderness. Whenever meetings of tribes or clans within tribes take place, Storm Keepers seek out their counterparts to share information and compare notes on weather patterns and elemental stirrings of the earth and sky. In a more urban society, Storm Keepers may meet at meteorologist conferences, global warming symposia or similar meetings.

To go beyond that, an Intelligence + Science + Forces roll is required, with each success allowing an additional degree of latitude for the mage. For example, a mage wishes to lessen the severity of a Category 3 hurricane. No roll is required to take the hurricane from Category 3 to Category 2. If the mage wishes to downsize the storm further, the above roll is mandatory. One success allows the mage to lower the storm to a Category 1.

Possible uses of this option include slowing down a storm long enough for residents of a town to take cover or hastening a storm so that its duration is spent before dark. This also allows a mage to move a lightning strike (using the “Call Lightning” ability, above) forward in time by as much as 10 minutes to enable individuals to move outside the strike zone (or, perversely, into it).",

        "descrizione": "<div>Humankind exists in a state of slavery. Children are reared for blind obedience to their superiors, whether adults, authority figures  or even bigger children. Education consists only fractionally of actual instruction — and then only in the procedural details of menial tasks — and mostly of conditioning towards the unquestioning acceptance of monotony, regimentation and redundancy. Negative reinforcement — pain and deprivation — requiring constant maintenance for diminishing returns, is extensively employed, while positive reinforcement — pleasure and reward — which maintains itself and encourages progress is seldom used, if not rejected outright. Dissent and alternative views are discouraged with such severity that the mere thought of them is stifled even before the thinker can utter them aloud. The modern adult emerges as a mass-produced domesticated robot, interchangeable with any other, his own slave driver and self-censor. The society formed by such people thus becomes an entity unto itself, bearing no responsibility to its disposable individual members, its insular communities enclosed and contained, its communication monitored and information flow regulated by living automata. Even the society’s ruling class is bound to a system beyond its control, bred and groomed for power by the same process of threats and punishment, its soul trapped within massive walls of denial erected against the degradation and debasement it inflicts upon its race. </div><div>Inhabitants of wealthy and civilized countries may consider the preceding to be subversive rhetoric, at best an overstatement of the price a society pays for its own security or a puerile emotional response to vague and ill-defined historical and sociopolitical forces. But the rest of the world understands that the obedient slave who has never tasted the lash can easily convince himself that he is free, his servitude offered voluntarily to well-meaning masters. And the Liberatores realize that this is only the tip of a most chilling iceberg. For the truth about the human condition, they point to the ghetto and shantytown, to dungeons and basements and shipping containers, to containment camps and torture chambers and rape rooms, to the barbed wire fence between desert and fertile field, to the windowless monolithic building, to the sweatshops of Saipan and the tourist brothels of Dubai, to the eyes of the kiddie-porn “star” and the screams of the toddler strapped to the racing-camel’s saddle. </div><div>Founded around the time of the American Civil War, the Liberatores claim spiritual descent from slaves that Awakened and helped to organize the Underground Railroad. The Liberatores worked, and continue to work, to abolish institutionalized slavery worldwide, but their focus has broadened considerably over the past century. Their primary efforts are still directed against the black market trade in human beings, but this Legacy also actively sabotages any activity that smacks of economic oppression or social control through mental and emotional abuse or deprivation.</div>",

        "firstAttainmentDescription": "<div>It is understandable that a person who has lived his entire life in a cage or bound in chains cannot conceive of any other mode of existence. Wage slaves and others who are kept in servitude by circumstance and overarching social systems exist in a similar state of being “brainwashed,” although in such cases the process is more insidious. While they may theoretically be free to change jobs, even careers or lifestyles, they were raised to believe that their options are limited and that the lives they currently lead are the best possible situations that they can hope for. In both cases, their bondage is assured by their artificially narrowed understanding of the world around them. </div<div>The first duty of the Liberatore is to dispel this illusion of limitation, to lift the slave’s mind out of a confinement that is, if not actually self-imposed, at least self-perpetuating. The slave must be aware of and yearn for a fundamentally different way of life or else carry his manacles with him forever even after his body has been freed from physical chains. The Liberatores use the Mind 2 spell “Emotional Urging” to accomplish this, instilling a wish for genuine freedom in the minds of those suffering from both overt and covert enslavement. The intent is to inspire the target with a hope for improving her lot in life. </div<div>Also, the mage has an indefinite-Duration Mind 2 “Mental Shield” that protects him (with a number of points equal to his Mind dots) from supernatural attempts to overcome his will.</div>",
        "firstAttainmentOptArcana": "Spirit 2",
        "firstAttainmentOptDescrizione": "<div>Some Liberatores take a more generalized or external approach to this duty by calling upon a spirit to do the work of inspiring the oppressed. Of course, since the Liberatores are Mastigos, that spirit will be demonic in essence; demons have a long mythic history of exclusion, punishment and servitude — not to mention a vehement hatred of such conditions and a burning desire to escape them. A dedicated and motivated spirit will use its own cunning and powers to inspire the lust for freedom. Furthermore, if the target ever achieves that freedom, the spirit will likely be raised in rank among its peers, and may even gain some degree of permanent identity in the physical world as a symbol of liberation. </div><div>The Liberatore can use an effect similar to the Spirit 2 “Lesser Spirit Summons,” although she can only call upon demonic spirits. To do so, she makes an instant Resolve + Intimidation + Spirit roll contested by the demon’s Resistance. The Liberatore who summons such a spirit can also use other magic (such as the higher levels of Spirit spells) to command the spirit or bind it to a particular person, group or place. The contradiction of enslaving a spirit to do the work of freeing others will not be lost on the intelligent spirit, however, and so this tactic is to be avoided. Demons in particular are notorious for adhering to the letter of a command while subverting its intent. Yearning for liberation can very easily be transformed into violent rage against the slave drivers, an envious desire to enslave one’s former masters or even a bitter hatred of one’s fellow slaves.</div>",

Clear thought is needed to skillfully manipulate one’s situation, outbursts of indignant rage must be suppressed in order to prevent retaliatory punishment and an increase in security measures and courage is definitely needed when the moment comes for open rebellion.</div><div>The second Attainment employs the effect of the Mind 3 spell “Augment the Mind” to reinforce a Liberatore’s resolve to endure whatever is necessary to gain the goal of liberation. When this Attainment is first gained, the mage must choose a single Mental or Social Attribute to boost. He cannot later choose a different Attribute. To boost this Attribute, he spends an instant action calling upon his passionate need for freedom; on the following turn (and for the remainder of the scene), he adds his Mind dots to the chosen Attribute. (If he casts a spell to boost this Attribute further, its default Duration is automatically transitory, regardless of its normal default Duration.)</div>",

        "thirdAttainmentDescription": "<div>As was pointed out under the first Attainment, the most debilitating, persistent and insidious effect of forced servitude is its degradation and diminishment of the human soul. Those who have spent all or most of their lives in captivity may be overwhelmed by the responsibility that accompanies freedom, and some former slaves actually feel that they were better off before they were liberated. (Some social psychologists recognize this in the phenomenon of the “institutionalized men,” a term often applied to former convicts who violate parole  and commit crimes so that they can trade back their ineptitude at participating in society at large for the comparative security and regularity of prison life.) Some are so deeply conditioned to a social structure of dominance and submission that they incapable of sustaining any relationships that are not inherently manipulative, exploitative or oppressive. For these freed ones, liberation is simply a matter of exchanging a new master for an old one, or else an opportunity to begin exercising power over others as was previously done to them. </div><div>To ensure that the freed can truly become and remain free, much of the efforts of the Liberatores are committed to deconditioning and deprogramming those they liberate. For this, the Mind 4 “Breach the Vault of Memory” effect can be most efficacious. The mage makes an instant Manipulation + Persuasion + Mind roll, contested by the target’s Resolve + Composure. The mage can choose to suffer dice penalties on his roll to extend the effect’s Duration, just as he would with an instant spellcasting. The Liberatore can repeatedly condition a target once the initial conditioning is about to expire, allowing him to extend the effect as long as he can keep up regular conditioning. </div><div>Masters of this Legacy are most likely to be found in fortresses and institutional compounds with heavy security — both to keep out the forces of corrupt oppressive authorities and to contain the freed slaves who would still present some danger to the world if they were released unconditionally. Extensive mind-altering techniques, from basic education to deep psychotherapy involving all sorts of mind-magic, are applied to heal psychic trauma and ultimately empower the traumatized. (Of course, to the unenlightened observer such a place might appear indistinguishable from the very slave camps or illegal prisons that its inhabitants were rescued from.)</div>",

        "descrizione": "<div>All Moros experience death during their Awakenings. The Path of Doom begins with moving beyond the mortal coil, however briefly. Most Moros feel that death is peaceful, but some see it as rootless, frightening and without direction, a maelstrom of uncertainty and pain.Those are the Moros most likely to become Bojor and command their own armies of the dead.</div><div>The Bokor philosophy is fairly simple, but heretical to the rest of the Moros Path. Death is not peaceful, say the Bokor, and it is not dignified. It is messy, painful and demeaning. “That last last thing a dying man does,” say Bokor tutors to their apprentices, “is shit his pants.” The Bokor take the Moros attitude of respect and sobriety with a grim smile and a spiteful laugh. But the Bokor are not tricksters or jesters. They want power, and they feel that the bodies of the dead provide a good path to that power. </div><div>The word “bokor” is used in the Vodoun faith to refer to a priest or shaman who performs black magic, often for money. Bokor are considered responsible for the “zombie powder” that changes a living person into an unliving servant, as well as other well-known maleficent aspects of Vodoun. Curses that bring disease and bad luck, dolls made to resemble the person a bokor wants to harm and the entreaty of spirits to bedevil the bokor’s enemies have all been laid at the feet of these individuals. To what extent did the Bokor Legacy influence these legends? The answer is lost to time, but it is true that the Legacy is strongest in Haiti and other Caribbean nations where some form of Vodoun is in common practice.  The arts of the Bokor are brutal, bloody and effective. They are primarily concerned with preparing living people to become zombies upon death, and with creating those zombies. The Bokor do not, as a rules, care whose bodies they animate. To the Bokor, a person ceases to be a person at the instant of death. The soul departs, and all that is left is matter. That matter can then be animated, given power and tasks.  As the Bokor grow in power, they can gain the ability to kill with a glance, and a potent member of this Legacy may kill a man and turn him into a zombie before his body hits the ground. </div><div>The Bokor’s method of raising a body to service involves nothing more than a glance or a whispered invocation, at least outwardly. Inwardly, however, the Bokor thinks of himself as a king of the dead, able to stride the worlds of the living and the deceased by dint of the Awakening. Raising a body as a zombie, therefore, is no different than calling an obedient dog. While some Bokor take the time to paint corpses with glyphs (often in blood or wet flour) in order to ensure that their service continues longer than an hour or so, others rely on their skill alone to create lasting servants. </div><div>Despite the Bokor’s blasé attitude about corpses, the Bokor refuse to have any truck with ghosts. The Bokor believe that ghosts are fragments of human souls, and that by helping a ghost to move on (by destroying  its anchors or severing its connection to them) the Bokor can help the soul to repair itself. If a Bokor discovers that a ghost is anchored to its own corpse, the Bokor will never  raise that corpse as a zombie (though the mage might destroy it). A soul is whole at the moment of death, however, and powerful Bokor can stop the soul from fleeing and bind it back into its now-dead body. This creates a powerful undead creature called a revenant, capable of much more independent and complex action than a standard zombie. Creating a revenant, however, is the only way in which a Bokor feels comfortable affecting a human soul. Severing or holding a soul in an object is taboo  to them. This differentiates them with the bokor of Vodoun, who are infamous for placing souls in clay jars called canari tonnerre and using them to force the souls’ barely living bodies into service. </div><div>Every Bokor has her own grandiose dreams of power. This might involve conquest of a particular area, slaying all the descendants of an enemy or acquisition of wealth, but the goal is very rarely “magical knowledge.” The Bokor are unabashedly physical and greedy, and look down on such lofty ideals as  wisdom and humility. Unlike their parent Path, they do not see the fragility of life as a call to greater moral and behavioral rectitude. On the contrary, the Bokor see that life is short and death is uncertain, and so they take what they want, using the undead  as their foot soldiers, mules and assassins.</div> ",

While Sleepers, of course, cannot sense this change, they do notice it inasmuch as the target is easy to overlook. Social rolls made by the target receive a –2 modifier. Also, the Bokor has a perfect sense of where the target is after she leaves his presence, as the Space 1 “Finder” spell (see p. 233 of Mage: The Awakening).

Zombies raised by Bokor are always considered “indestructible,” that is, they do not have a specific vulnerability that destroys them instantly. </div><div>These zombies are also impossible to “steal” from the Bokor. Another mage might attempt to use the Death Arcanum to wrest control of these undead minions away from the Bokor,  but because the animation is based on an Attainment and not a spell, this is not possible. A Bokor’s minions belong to him until they are destroyed or until the Bokor releases them. Also, if the Bokor encounters zombies raised by other mages or by other phenomena, he can attempt to bring them under his control.

This Attainment can only be used on targets within sensory range, and cannot be used to force targets into tasks inimical to their nature. The Attainment requires an instant and contested action.

        "descrizione": "<div>Mages tend to be fairly cerebral; after all, knowledge literally is power for the Awakened, and their thoughts do indeed shape reality. Some willworkers, however, place the mind and its innate powers above all else, and make the refinement of the mind their ultimate goal. Having already transcended the mundane through their initiation at the Watchtowers, they come to regard all mundane things as hindrances to overcome. The body is merely an encumbrance to the enlightened mind.  </div><div>To the Ascended Adept, those who focus on perfecting the body as a means of attaining understanding miss the point. The body is only a vehicle for the mind. While you can certainly breed a better and faster horse over time, why not build yourself a rocket ship instead and leave your old, outdated mode of transportation behind? If you weigh yourself down with the limitations of humanity and mortality, how can you ever truly ascend?  </div><div>The Ascended Adept is an acorn that does not fear destroying itself in order to grow into an oak. Mages cannot remain within the safety of their shells; they must stretch out, reach beyond their limits and rise toward the light of the Supernal Realm, leaving material things behind. Anything else is simply delusion, crafting a fine and gilded cage in the confines of the Fallen World. Only the essential self, the mind, the portion that says “I AM,” is real and can transcend.  </div><div>The process begins with learning to discipline the mind and overcome the lies that bind it. An untrained mind is chaotic, filled with uncontrolled thoughts and desires, ruled by the needs of the body. The training of the Ascended Adept quiets the tumult, calms the chaos, and enthrones the will above all. Ascended Adepts learn to meditate and reach a deep place of inner peace, allowing them to remain calm in the most difficult circumstances. They also build the strength of will to resist the outside influences that bombard the mind.  </div><div>In achieving this discipline, the Adept sheds connections with the physical. Material possessions are discarded, save for those necessary for the work. Physical needs are mastered and controlled; physical relationships are allowed to fall away in favor of intellectual and spiritual communion. Some Ascended Adepts retire to cloistered communities or hermitages during the early stages of their training, to gain the perspective and peace needed for their work. Others have a talent for standing alone even in the midst of a crowd, and do not need any such assistance.</div><div>Once the foundations are laid, the Adept can begin refining and improving the capabilities of the mind. When quiet and clear of distractions, the mind has remarkable powers. The Adept learns to wander the halls of memory, ordering and recalling things at will, improving the ability to memorize large amount of information. Mental training allows Adepts to think about multiple things at once, creating complex thought process modern mages liken to parallel computer processing. The thoughts of the ascended adept are both deep and broad, encompassing more than most people can imagine. </div><div>The Adept learns mastery of dreams and even unconscious thoughts, making the mind into a palace ruled by the will, where no thought escapes the Adept’s notice or control. The organization of the mental faculties provides the insight required to understand the process of moving on to the next stage. </div><div>Those who have mastered the mind, who have learned to understand that the body is nothing more than its vehicle, can eventually leave the body behind. The Ascended Adept learns to exist as pure mentality, a “being of light” as some call it, leaving the body behind like a coat hanging on a hook. In this enlightened state, the mage can wander the material world in the state of Twilight, free from the limitations of flesh and blood, at least for a time. However, the mind is still tied to the body, and must eventually return there. Some Ascended Adepts are able to remain in states of deep trance for days before their wandering minds must return, but even they must attend to the body’s needs on occasion. The ideal goal is to truly ascend to a higher plane, shedding the need for a physical body altogether, but such a mighty feat of magic takes incredible devotion and insight. Some say the apparent lack of Ascended Adepts who have achieved ascension to a higher plane is proof their way is flawed.  </div><div>The Adepts counter that the things truly worth doing are rarely ever easy. If everyone could transcend, they would have done so. If transcendence involves moving beyond the limits of the Fallen World, then few Ascended beings will be found there.  </div><div>There are Ascended Adepts who say they have encountered the “Secret Masters” of their Legacy, abiding deep in the realms of thoughts and dreams, and that these enlightened few still guide those on the Path to achieving what they have attained. Outsiders are less sanguine about such tales, and speculate instead as to who — or what — these so-called Secret Masters may be. After all, the Exarchs may be said to have “ascended” as well, and there are more than a few Ascended Adepts among the Seers of the Throne. </div>",

Jewelry and other adornments are likewise rare, since material things have no intrinsic value. Hair tends to be either worn long or completely shorn. In either case, Ascended Adepts pay little heed to their hair.

Called “the Palace of Memory,” this allows the Adept to order his mind and think more efficiently. Some connect the Palace of Memory with the Akashic Records, the universal memory. Finally, Ascended Adepts learn to transcend the body, freeing the mind to act on its own.

        "descrizione": "<div>Neocologists are convinced that nature, as they know and revere it, is effectively doomed by the actions of humanity. Rather than watch the spirits they know wither and die away, however, Neocologists seek to prevent this both by reclaiming areas of the industrialized world and by infusing as much of the magical and spiritual world as possible into the artificial world, creating a synthesis of the natural and the artificial. Neocologists imagine themselves as a spiritual evacuation force helping to place spirits into new phenomena and transfer natural principles into artificial vessels.If they can’t reclaim the natural world entirely, they hope at least to see that the mechanized and artificial world follows the same natural principles that have guided the world thus far—the same ancient  cycles, survival of the fittest, self-replication and so on.</div><div>The Legacy’s  name is a portmanteau combining neo (new) and ecology, suggesting that they’re creating a whole new synthesis through their work.</div><div>There has been little time for any wide-scale results to come from the Neocologists’ efforts. The Legacy came about in the late 19th century, a response by a handful of British mages — alleged inheritors of the secrets of Atlantis, by way of the druids — to the devastation caused by the Industrial Revolution. </div><div>Though industry was yet young, Shamans with access to the Time Arcanum saw that the outlook for the natural world only got worse the further into the future one looked, and so it was decided that something had to be done. The industrialization of the world wasn’t about to be stopped, even by the awakened, but something had to happen if the natural and spiritual landscape was to survive. Ultimately, Neocologists chose to fuse the natural and artificial worlds, and where that wouldn’t work, they would endeavor to preserve enough of true nature so that when civilization collapses on itself, there will be enough of the natural world to act as seed for renewal.</div><div>Despite the Path they come from, Neologists are rigidly civilized (or they try to present themselves as such, until their passions nudge aside the carefully groomed masks they like to wear). This derives from the legacy’s history more than anything. The deeply ingrained sense of Victorian propriety was such that many Thyrsus mage couldn’t — or wouldn’t — turn their backs on modernity, despite seeing the toll it was taking on the bodies and spirits of urbanites and on the natural world itself. Instead, Neocologists pledged themselves to preserving the principles of nature — and the possibility of regrowth and renewal once the cycle of industrialism collapsed upon itself. Their goal is to defendas much of the natural world as possible, by hiding it within the industrialized world itself, or in the interstices between industrialized zones.</div><div>Neocologists refer to the act of putting natural spirits into human-made vessels as “translating” the spirit. While the spirit undergoes some unavoidable changes to its nature in the process, the spirit retains enough of its identity that the spirit stands a decent chance of surviving, and while that’s not much, it beats the complete transmogrification or utter dissolution that the spirit would suffer otherwise. </div><div>Unlike the majority of those who Awaken on the Thyrsus Path, Neocologists force themselves to reside in the modern world, and refuse to look away from what they see as a horrendous but unavoidable development. They channel their considerable passions into changing the status quo in a direction that gives hope for the natural and spiritual landscape. As they see it, most others on their Path would rather bury their heads in the sand and live a life of denial than play the hands they’ve been dealt. </div><div>From their vantage point, many Neocologists see the majority of Thyrsus mages as Luddites and anachronisms. These Neocologists insist that at this point, there is no going backward to a time without industry, there is only going forward to get to a point where humankind and nature are interdependent instead of mutually exclusive. The point is not to do without science, but to move forward as quickly as possible, with the help of magic, to get to better science that is less harmful to the physical and spiritual landscape.</div><div>Neocologists study the modern world, especially the shallow new spirits that have arisen from human works and the changes the modern world has inflicted on the spiritual landscape. What they see horrifies them, although the developments of the last few decades have shown them a new way for them to reclaim the world, through a magically assisted form of bioremediation. </div>",

That said, Neocologists use what they know about the Invisible Realms to help them live as lightly on the world as possible. These mages are no more impervious to low Wisdom scores than any other mages, however, and when their Wisdom falls, they degrade socially in the same way that other Thyrsus mages do (see page XX), with their bestial natures eclipsing their higher functions.",

Though they returned with the wisdom of primordial magic, it doesn’t erase all that they knew from before their Awakening. The first Neocologist cabal took shape in England at the height of the Industrial Revolution, but the Legacy has since spread both east and west, and members of this Legacy can be found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.

They flirt with madness and the Left-Hand  Path at every turn of their enlightenment. Perhaps most damning of all, they cannot claim that reputation as untrue, though it is myopic.</div><div>Mages who embrace this legacy certainly do engage in Goetia, and are highly interested in the deepest mysteries of the human mind, as it pertains to wickedness, vice and weakness.Many who seek to master their inner demons stumble from narrow, treacherous discipline and find themselves walking a Left-Hand Path. </div><div>Nevertheless, the Clavicularius Legacy offers great rewards for mages who have sufficient will and courage. Elder Solomonists become mages of great and terrible power, tall bastions of the  kind of virtue that comes not from denying evil within, but from confronting it, defeating it and forging it into a weapon — something that the mages control, rather than being controlled.</div><div>Clavicularii consider themselves modern-day inheritors of King Solomon, the virtuous king who summoned demons to build a great temple and palace in which he ruled in wisdom. The Clavicularius mage follows the lessons Solomon left behind. The mage, having confronted her own vices, feels qualified to confront the sins of everyone else. As a result, some initiates of this Legacy seem fearsomely judgmental; others take a softer, more compassionate approach but, nevertheless, do not permit other people to compromise the initiates’ morals.</div><div>A Clavicularius initiate often seeks to bring out the best in those around him. The concept of ordering an infant cut in half in order to flush out which woman is really its mother is archetypal of Clavicularian thought: force a moral crisis in order to expose deception. At any given time, a Clavicularius may work on a “pet project,” putting a Sleeper through a crucible with the intention of strengthening her, by whatever means necessary. A corporate executive who finds she must deal with a business crisis and the debilitating illness of a child at home may be going through such a crucible. A Clavicularius rarely uses his magic for the overt good of a person he tests; most of the time, the Clavicularius alters the world around the one he seeks to strengthen, forcing his subject to find the strength to overcome her vices and weaknesses of character.</div><div>A Keeper of the Keys delves deeply into her own psyche, seeking out her greatest weaknesses; such a mage usually knows her personal Vice. Indeed, not only are Clavicularii aware of their Vices, but the Solomonists make a point to carry out dialogues with their Vices, through their mastery of Goetic magics.</div><div>These mages make extensive use of the Keys of Solomon, a system of sigils, pentacles and seals meant to invoke, control or banish demons that correspond to the moral and psychological weaknesses of humans and mages. Sleeper occultists believe the Keys themselves have power. The Awakened understand the true meaning of these symbols. The sigils are not mystic in and of themselves; rather, they are a shorthand description for demons that personify different sins and desires, codified by Goetic mages of long ago. Mages can use these sigils, and the devils to which they refer, as “standard forms” when the mages want to wrestle or evoke their inner demons. The Legacy’s most popular oblation is the Rite of Castigation, wherein a demon that embodies a mage’s Vice or derangement is symbolically invoked under a Solomonic name, punished and banished, reaffirming the mage’s power and will.</div>",

Therefore, the orders watch known Solomonists carefully, for fear of the chaos that results when a Key-Bearer calls up what she cannot put down again.</div><div>That said, fully a quarter of the Key-Bearers were not originally Mastigos, but found their way into the Legacy’s sanctums through their membership in the Silver Ladder. The remnants of the Vox Draconis remember how these arts once gave humanity power over demons, forcing humankind to face and overcome its own weaknesses and evil. Furthermore, this Legacy has ties to King Solomon, if only through myth and archetype. To the Silver Ladder, Solomon provides a model of the Awakened ruling over those who yet Sleep: stern yet wise, his power guided by justice.</div><div>Members of the Adamantine Arrow initiated into the Clavicularius defend the Awakened and Sleepers alike from the depredations of demons and the Scelesti. These mages follow the example set by Les Enfants de Sévérité, the famous cabal of demon-hunters who founded the Clavicularius. On the other hand, the Legacy’s implications for psychotherapy interest Solomonists of the Free Council, who usually deal in Goetic demons with a distinctly modern cast. Such Goeticists like to classify the various inner demons in terms of Jungian archetypes or Freudian complexes, and experiment with ways to bind and banish each kind of entity.</div><div>Those Guardians of the Veil initiated into the Clavicularius respect the heights of virtue to which this Legacy aspires. Most such mages are themselves usually seeking to overcome their own weaknesses and to understand the powers of fallen mages who may threaten the secrecy of the Awakened. Mysterium members who find their way among the Solomonists are usually drawn by the promise of secrets; these mages are amply rewarded for their dedication.</div>",

Indeed, Solomonists are sometimes thought of as classic Mastigos or Silver Ladder mages in appearance, for the Key-Bearers enjoy fine clothing and a generally powerful appearance. They prefer expensive, tailored clothing, usually the height of political or business fashion. Among the Clavicularius, the idea of a “power tie” is often taken quite seriously.</div><div>Nearly every member of the Clavicularius bears some article of jewelry inscribed with one of the Keys of Solomon. Additionally, many of the Clavicularius prefer the use of regalia, usually a regal robe or mantle and some kind circlet or coronet, when performing extensive Goetic magic. Clavicularii like symbols of their own inherent kingship over their own fears.</div>",

More importantly, however, Mastigos envision Pandemonium not merely as a place of chaos but one of personal torment are often drawn to this legacy, for it isn’t enough to be interested in demons. Simple infernalism has no place among the Clavicularius – a Solomonist’s demons are always personal, whether a source of power or a means of overcoming deep shame.",
        "organizzation": "The Clavicularius are organized only by levels of attainment: one is considered a Seeker at the first attainment, a Keeper at the second and an Elder at the third. Most Clavicularius know several others, even if they don’t live in the same area, and maintain regular contact, especially with their tutors. Intra-Legacy relations are strange to outsiders, for Solomonists seem absolutely frank about the kinds of things other mages seek to keep from others – failings, nightmares and other weaknesses.<div>However, the Clavicularius are not some kind of mutual sympathy society – they have nothing but scorn for the failings of their brethren, unless those failings are fought and overcome. Each victory is celebrated, but each failure is met with contempt and scornful advice on how to do better. Outsiders sometimes compare the Clavicularius to a group of extreme sports enthusiasts for their daring and braggadocio, constantly challenging each other to excel and rewarding those who do with prestige and admiration. </div><div>Because of this attitude, the Clavicularius don’t turn away mages who are deeply flawed or psychologically unstable. A mage who enters the Legacy as someone ruled by rage or who bears terrible phobias finds that his fellow mages laud his victories greatly. The mage who suffered from crippling mental illness and defeated that terrible demon has more right to his pride than one who overcame simple fears and childhood anxieties.</div>",

Indeed, the Keepers of the Keys often perform their initiations in Hebrew. Some linguists among the Solomonists question whether these Hebrew incantations are genuine hold-overs or latter-day additions meant to make the rites seem more “authentic.” Most Key-Bearers say that honoring the legendary mage-king as their Legacy’s exemplar matters more than niggling details of historical exactitude.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Les Enfants de Sévérité</h3><div>The first recorded gathering of Clavicularius mages who identified themselves as such was Les Enfants de Sévérité, or the Children of Severity. This cabal of Solomonists formed in 17th-century France to investigate rumors of infernalism in the court of Louis XIV. Les Enfants consisted of one member from each of the four Atlantean orders.</div><div>Though the cabal found nothing more than titillating occultism and a bit of clumsy political poisoning among the Sleepers, Les Enfants did discover a trio of Scelesti who used “Black Masses” as a cover for their own goals. Les Enfants are upheld as role models for young Clavicularius mages: unrelentingly virtuous, magnificently terrifying and goetically adept.</div><div>To this day, most Solomonists trace their lineage of initiation back to one of the four mages of Les Enfants. Though many of the mages attracted to Les Enfants quickly left, finding their ways distasteful (and perhaps a bit too frightening), the four mages trained 11 more skilled Goeticists, who went on to initiate others into the Legacy.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Recent Events</h3><div>The next upswelling in membership came about because of trends in Sleeper society. Young mages who Awakened in the 1970s and 1980s spent their youth bombarded with demonic imagery in music, comic books, movies and other mass media. In fact, quite a few of these young mages found their way to Awakening while trying to perform “Satanic rituals” out of some paperback purchased at a mall bookstore or cobbled together from movies and album lyrics. Not surprisingly, many of these young mages showed a tremendous interest in demons and demonology.</div><div>More than a few mentors found this interest ill-amusing, but they found a way to discourage rash inquiries into the infernal: the mentors sent their students for a year or two of training under the Clavicularius. The mentors knew full well the effect that Solomonist discipline would have on thrill-seeking young mages.</div><div>Most of these apprentices learned the intended lesson. Foolhardy young mages are more than willing to brave the threats of Hell itself, but they are less prepared to look into the face of their own greatest failings, weaknesses and traumas (or, to be honest, undertake the hard work required by this strenuously disciplined Legacy). However, some of these mages did stay and today form an important cohort in the Legacy’s membership.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Mages initiated into the Clavicularius must accept that they are flawed, broken, weak beings. Rather than taking this as an excuse for humility or despair, however, Solomonists consider weakness a challenge. The sacred  work of a Key-Bearer is not only to repair this faulty foundation, but to build a mighty edifice of the strengthened and Awakened soul upon it.</div><div>The practices of Goetia are incredibly hubris-ridden. Most Goeticists quickly descend into paranoia and self-loathing, faced as they are by their own failings on such a routine basis. A demon that embodies one’s own innate cowardice is impossible to deceive with bluster, and the demon that gives form to the internal voice that whispers to a mage that he deserved the abuse he suffered from his parents cannot be ignored.</div><div>This is where the Clavicularius stand above other practitioners of Goetia. Key-Bearers are not content simply to face and acknowledge their failings. Instead, they try to hammer every weakness into a tool for their own use. A cowardly Goeticist claims that his fear is a valuable tool for ensuring survival; a Solomonist maintains that it is an opportunity to learn the true essence of valor, allowing her the chance to confront fear tangibly, over and again, until she masters it. That a bound and mastered demon of cowardice gives power over everyone else’s latent timidity is a bonus.</div><div>People who encounter Clavicularius mages often find them arrogant and egotistical. The Key-Bearers say they are arrogant because they deserve to be. Who else confronts their own failings with such determination, throwing themselves against their weaknesses time and again, until they conquer them?</div><div>Or, until the Key-Bearers are conquered themselves. Many who initiate into this Legacy do not achieve its heights, and some even fall and plummet into the Abyss. As a result, Solomonists are regarded with no small concern by other mages, and rightly so.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Greater Rite of Castigation</h3><div>No one watches the Keepers of the Keys as closely as their own brethren. Nobody knows the potential for disaster better than those who face that threat constantly, and the Clavicularius are proud, but not stupid. They are utterly cognizant of the dangers of Goetia.</div><div>As a result, the Clavicularius evolved a form of checks and balances that would astound most mages for its invasiveness. The Greater Rite of Castigation is based on the oblation practiced by all Solomonists. However, rather than simply a ritual for re-establishing a sense of self, the Greater Rite is a literal summoning of the demons of a mage’s psyche for other Solomonists to interrogate and punish. The subject of this rite is necessarily present when the demon is summoned and imprisoned within a warding. At that point, however, the mage is banished from the room, to allow those gathered to interrogate his personal demon.</div><div>The Greater Rite of Castigation is always led by an initiate of the third attainment, but other Clavicularii usually attend. These rites are not performed with any particular frequency; any elder of the Clavicularius may propose a Greater Rite for any member of the Legacy.</div><div>As might be imagined, the Greater Rite is a harrowing experience for a young mage. If his internal demons are found to be too strong or powerful, he is subject to the admonitions of his seniors, who will gather to discuss the problem with him and help him find ways to strengthen himself.</div><div>Though initiates of the Legacy are not required to follow such admonitions, they have ample reason to do so: mages who fail to acknowledge the findings of the interrogators and follow their advice risks being branded Scelesti by their fellow Clavicularius. If there is one thing a Consilium takes seriously, it is a charge of Nefandi from mages of this Legacy.</div><div>Despite the emotional risks (or perhaps because of them), most Clavicularius mages do not wait until their actions arouse concern in their elders. Instead, they approach their elders themselves to request the Greater Rite of Castigation, seeking the wisdom of their brethren in order to better ascertain and repair their own weaknesses.</div><div>Younger Clavicularius sometimes develop something of a thrill-seeker’s attitude to the Greater Rite. They take pride in ferreting out their own failings, so that they can take steps to rectify them. Some among the latest generation of Solomonist mages have even taken to tattooing their bodies with the Solomonic sigil of the demon that most strongly embodies their Vice. Older Key-Bearers frown on such displays. They feel the tattoo smacks of defining one’s self by one’s weakness, rather than the conquering thereof, but such tattooing has not been forbidden.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Astral Plane</h3><div>The Clavicularius know that Goetic demons exist because those weaknesses exist within the mage himself, but the Astral Plane also holds many other entities. The Solomonists spend much time in exploring the Astral Plane, particularly the domain of Temenos, which they regard as most closely analogous to the collective soul of humanity. Astral journeys form the cornerstone pf the Legacy’s practice. Indeed, all initiations within the Legacy happen upon the astral plane, within the Great Temple of Solomon.</div><div>The Great Temple of Solomon is not, of course, the actual temple of the legendary king. Rather, it is an astral construct created as a haven for Clavicularius gatherings. The four members of Les Enfants created the temple construct in the 17th century, as a place where the initiations of their apprentices might take place. It has stood since then, bolstered by Clavicularius masters.</div><div>The Temple itself is a sprawling edifice of gleaming white marble. Ten feet off the ground, along every wall, runs a foot-wide strip of gold etched with the various seals and pentacles of the Keys of Solomon. Many young Clavicularius learn the sigils’ meanings here.</div><div>These halls are far from bustling, however. At most times, only a mage and his mentor are visiting. Occasionally, a pair might see another figure gliding along some far-off corridor, going about her business. Large gatherings of Goeticists rarely happen, for they are driven by their own sense of right and wrong, and attend to their own goals. Initiations of a new member form a notable exception: tutors put out the word about a new Key-Bearer, and their acquaintances in the Legacy visit the Temple to size up the new recruit.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Regal Self</h3><div>A central tenet of the Clavicularius is that of “the Regal Self.” During Solomonists’ initiation into the order, they perceive themselves seated upon a throne, watching themselves pay fealty, and kneeling before a throne, kowtowing to themselves. This marks the first step toward forging the mage into a Clavicularius. The experience remains with a Key-Bearer throughout her life.</div><div>In this fashion, the Legacy hammers home its ideal: the base, unworthy parts of the self must submit to those numinous, virtuous essences of the self. Throughout the rest of the apprentices’ training, Clavicularius mentors question their apprentices about their actions and ask, “Was that worthy of the person upon the throne or the person groveling before it?”</div><div>Clavicularii seek always to measure themselves by this standard. Any member who ceases to do so has begun to fall into the Abyss. To be sure, the tenets of humility that many magicians prize as necessary for enlightenment do tend to be rare among the Clavicularius, who see themselves as righteous sorcerer-kings. They are regal and benevolent in all things – or at least, they attempt to be.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Induction</h3><div>The Clavicularius do not share their Mysteries with just any one. Though they are often willing to teach the techniques of Goetia to mages they know and trust, not every Goeticist will be permitted to join the ranks of the Clavicularius. In fact, very few are welcome among the Keepers of the Keys without close examination and training.</div><div>A Goeticist who wants to learn the techniques of the Clavicularius must demonstrate her facility in at least the basics of Goetic practice. More than that, she needs a reputation as someone who struggles to achieve virtue. (The tendency of mages to watch potential apprentices to determine their Wisdom certainly applies here.)</div><div>An apprentice who meets a mentor’s strict standards will be welcomed into the fold. The first initiation into the rites of the Clavicularius is a harrowing experience that requires the ingestion of a powerful hallucinogen. The mentor shapes these hallucinations, using the Mind Arcanum to craft images of deeper and deeper terror and suffering. All the while, the apprentice answers questions designed to test her knowledge of Goetia, and trick her into revealing less-than-virtuous reasons for its pursuit.</div><div>The ordeal culminates in a journey to the Astral realms, to the Great Temple of Solomon in the Temenos. Once there, the apprentice finds herself at the foot of a great golden throne, sublime in its geometry and shape. A strange experience then occurs, unique to the experience of forging one’s soul into the first attainment of this Legacy. The student is simultaneously seated upon the throne and forced to kneel at the base of the throne, bowing and swearing fealty to herself.</div><div>Each initiation further into the Mysteries of the Legacy begins with a Greater Rite of Castigation, allowing senior Key-Bearers to judge the member’s self-mastery before initiation. The soulcrafting of the Clavicularius is directed towards a specific end — the utter mastery of the mage’s weaknesses and sins.</div>",
        "magic": "<h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic of the Clavicularius</h2><div>Standard Goetic magic is explained on pp. 323–326 of Mage: The Awakening. The Key-Bearers developed a variety of other rotes and spells within their Legacy, which they teach only to initiates.</div><div>At Mind 4, Clavicularius mages learn to aid others in confronting their flaws of spirit, casting the “Goetic Struggle” upon another person. Some Key-Bearers use the techniques of religious castigation or psychotherapy to help a subject bulwark herself against her personified sin. Conversely, the mage can project her own defeated Goetic demon on to another person and tell it to work its temptation.</div><div style='margin: 10px 0;'><div><b>Clavicularius Rote: Solomonic Authority</b></div><div><b>Dice Pool:</b> Presence + Intimidation + Mind</div><div>This rote, based on the spell “Goetic Struggle” (see p. 324, Mage: The Awakening) is considered an essential practice, and is named after a precept of the Clavicularius and some Silver Ladder mages: to rule another, one must rule oneself first.</div></div><div style='margin: 10px 0;'><div><b>Clavicularius Rote: Egregore of Sin</b></div><div><b>Dice Pool:</b> Presence + Occult + Spirit</div><div>This rote, based on the spell “Goetic Evocation,” is not recklessly taught. Using the appropriate Keys of Solomon, the Clavicularius grants his deepest sins a spiritual form, calling upon a manifestation of his inner demons through an intense summoning rite.</div></div><h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Evil Means, Good Ends</h3><div>The Clavicularius find several uses for their bound and defeated inner demons. One of the simplest is to destroy a wicked person through sin. For instance, a Key-Bearer might kill a drug dealer by possessing him with a demon that makes him crave his own product, leading to a fatal overdose. A cunning but crooked politician’s career could be wrecked by sending a lust-demon to lead him into “bimbo eruptions” (the demon can even become the bimbo, if the Clavicularius knows the Spirit Arcanum well enough).</div><div>Solomonists can also use Goetic demons to counter possession by other sorts of demons. The mage binds her inner demon through “Goetic Struggle,” then sends it (by Mind 4) into a possessed person’s mind with a command to fight the other demon. A brave Clavicularius (and there’s no other kind) can even project her own consciousness into the possessed person’s mind (via Mind 4 “Dream Traveler”) to join the fight.</div><div>Any use of Goetic demons can very easily become an act of Hubris. If a mage has “just cause,” however, and there’s really no less invasive way to stop an evildoer’s activities, the Storyteller can waive the degeneration roll — or at least grant a bonus die, since the character used her inner demons for a righteous cause.</div>",
        "attainmentsDescrizione": "<div>The attainments of the Clavicularius serve one goal — to make the Solomonist aware of the flaws in his soul, allowing him to isolate them and wall himself off from them, turning them into something almost outside of himself. The Clavicularius are then capable of using these flaws of character as weapons against others.</div><div>Additionally, such self-knowledge creates a mage who can better imprison those impulses, using her experience at restraining her Vice to keep her other sins in check.</div><div>Finally, this Legacy aims to grant absolute mastery over the Goetic demon that reflects one of the mage’s soul-deep sins. She can use its wicked powers and Influences for the pursuit of virtue and righteous domination.</div>",

Because of this, the Clavicularius can sense those taints within others, and project them onto others.</div><div>By inflaming his sin and projecting it onto another, the Clavicularius creates an impetus to behave in a similar fashion in his target. This acts like the Mind 2 “Emotional Urging” spell, including the ability for the Awakened to sense they are being manipulated. However, if the target already possesses the Vice projected by the Clavicularius, she is immune to this attainment – a soul that already battles its own internal sin is immune to that same sin from an outside source.</div><div>Clavicularius mentors warn their initiates about using this attainment frivolously, for driving others to acts of sin can be an act of Hubris.</div>",

The psychic shield’s base duration is an entire day, however, and when the spell is performed, the Clavicularius may choose to protect himself not only from his Vice but from an additional Mental Flaw, Vice or derangement as well. The mage must decide which mental weakness or sin his Goetic Bulwark will protect against.</div><div>Any time the Clavicularius could have his behavior altered by a Mental Flaw or derangement, his player makes a contested roll of the character’s Gnosis + Mind opposed by his own Resolve + Composure.

If the Resolve + Composure roll wins, the character cannot resist his weakness and does not gain a Willpower point for the indulgence.</div><div>A mage may be protected by only a single Goetic Bulwark at a time.

Additionally, the character does not need to roll against the influence of that weakness: the Vice, sin or Flaw cannot exert power over the mage while she has bound its demonic manifestation. The actual binding of this demon uses a dice pool of the mage’s Presence + Intimidation + Mind.</div><div>Use of this power does not prevent the use of Goetic Bulwark, for they are two different powers.

The Coming Race will live in the risen land under the benevolent, absolute rule of the Awakened!</div><div>Some mages dismiss this vision as a pipe dream. Some recoil in horror from its faintly totalitarian undertones. The Daksha, on the other hand, not only believe this is the truest, worthiest goal for the Awakened but also believe that it can be attained, and attained soon. These odd, obsessive mages believe they know how to transform the world — and they make sure everyone else knows it, too. </div><div>The Daksha believe that for the Quiescence (which they call Kali Yuga, the Age of Strife) to end, mages must repair the Cosmic Cycle. Atlantis will rise again — literally — when the human race achieves its next stage of evolution in the Advent’s esoteric account of human history. The Daksha believe human evolution follows a cycle of seven stages. During the third stage of the current cycle, however, humanity’s precursors fell from a state of grace. To continue the cycle properly and resume the evolutionary journey to Cosmic Oneness, humanity must reverse the wrong turnings of past ages. </div><div>Long before Atlantis, the Daksha say, a greater race than humanity lived on the continent of Lemuria. These superior precursors were perfect androgynes unfettered by our own flawed duality of gender. The hermaphroditic Lemurians also possessed a third eye in the back of their heads, with which they saw the Akashic Record of Supernal Truth.</div><div>The Daksha use a process called Daksha-Yoga to transform themselves into Lemurians. As each Daksha gains mastery of Daksha-Yoga, she develops a third eye on the back of her head before achieving perfect androgyny. The greatest Daksha become as physically perfect as human beings — three-eyed, hermaphroditic human beings — can be. These Daksha are the Advent, first of the Coming Race, the harbingers of the next stage in human evolution.</div><div>The Dhyanis — a cabal of eight archmages who achieved the fourth attainment of Daksha-Yoga — guide the Daksha from a hidden sanctum somewhere in India. These archmages taught Daksha-Yoga to the modern world. Each Dhyan, in turn, communes with an Ancient Master, a Supernal being of undefined power who imparts the wisdom of the past for the development of the future. The Dhyanis say the Masters are magically aware former inhabitants of Atlantis. Most of the Daksha believe the Masters are Oracles.</div><div>Daksha-Yoga demands that the Legacy’s adherents learn enough Atlantean lore to recreate the lost land’s civilization. To this end, the Daksha study every trace of Atlantis they can find and work tirelessly to reclaim its lost magic. They contribute some of the Mysterium’s most expert mystic archaeologists. Time is short: Atlantis will soon rise, the Dhyanis say, and the Awakened need to prepare for their destiny as renewed masters of the world. And the Daksha make sure everyone else knows they are ready to take up their duty.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "The Advent",
        "orders": "<div>From their beginning, the Daksha associated with the Mysterium. The vast majority of Daksha still come from that order, or join it. The Legacy’s founders were all Obrimos, but Daksha tutors will train mages of other paths if they belong to the Mysterium. The order holds the Daksha in high regard, though it’s widely known the Daksha make their own studies before they tell other Mysterium members about the best lore and artifacts they find. As long as the Mysterium gets to see the goods eventually, its leaders grant the Daksha their private collection. Still, the Daksha gain more from the Mysterium than the Mysterium gains from the Daksha.</div><div>A few Daksha who research the warfare of Atlantis join the Adamantine Arrow. These mages tend to be better at the theory of conflict than at actual fighting. The Silver Ladder attracts other Daksha who try to convince the order to follow their vision of a new world ruled by the Awakened. The Daksha, as masters of self-publicity, don’t often see much use for the Guardians of the Veil, but some Advent decide the best way to learn secrets is to become one of the keepers.</div><div>Very few Daksha see any reason to join the Free Council. The leaders of the Free Council are in no hurry to invite the Advent, Atlantean literalists all, into their order. Daksha are certainly not banned from the Free Council, but any Advent would need a very good personal reason to join, and some assurance that he would get some benefit from the association. </div>",

Their bodies are slender, supple and toned.<div>Most carry themselves with grace and poise. Every Advent who achieves the first attainment of Daksha-Yoga grows a third eye in the back of her head; the eye is perfectly round and entirely black. Normally, a Daksha hides the eye under a headscarf, a turban or long hair.</div><div>Daksha who achieve the second attainment change even more, to the point that their own friends barely recognize them. As hermaphrodites, these Daksha perfectly meld the attributes of both genders. Voices rise or lower a register to become a soft tenor or alto, hips, waists and breasts change in shape and stance alters to reflect an altered distribution�of body mass. Some Daksha can pass as members of either sex, if their clothes are loose enough.</div>",
        "background": "The Daksha can come from any background; the Legacy’s only requirements are a fervent belief in Atlantis, an interest in human evolution and a great deal of self-control. The Legacy’s founder thought ethnic origin reflected evolutionary potential (although many Daksha prefer not to think about it). Officially, the Legacy no longer says that only mages of Caucasian or Indian descent can join the Coming Race. In the last few decades, individual Daksha have trained members of other ethnic groups. Unofficially, Daksha of other races suffer abuse and disdain from Advent who hold more “traditional” (racist) views, and the Dhyanis have done nothing to prevent it.",
        "organizzation": "<div>The Daksha observe a strict hierarchy. A student always defers to her tutor. The tutor, in turn, defers to a cabal of Daksha responsible for the Legacy’s activities in his section of the world. Regional divisions cover South and East Asia, the Middle East and Africa, Europe (including all of Russia), the Americas and a new division for Australia and Oceania. The regional cabals take their orders from the central Daksha cabal in Chennai (formerly called Madras), which oversees the Legacy’s activities in India directly. The Chennai cabal answers to the Dhyanis, who transmit their instructions from their undisclosed sanctum. Seats in the ruling cabals are for life. The Dhyanis select the members of the Chennai cabal, who in turn appoint the regional cabals.</div><div>Notwithstanding this organization, the Daksha find themselves deeply divided. Factions within the Advent often work against each other. Apart from regional competition, their main dispute comes from humanity’s fate when the Kali Yuga ends and Atlantis rises. Some Daksha would just ignore the un-evolved humans when the New World begins, and leave them behind on the old lands. Other Daksha seek a means to evolve everyone to the Daksha’s level. Most Advent expect a more Darwinian outcome, in which the un-evolved gradually die out. A few Advent don’t want to wait. When Kali Yuga ends, these few intend to wipe the un-evolved from the face of the planet.</div><div>Each Dhyani adopts the name of an Atlantean deity, as given in the Stanzas of Dzyan, the central text of Daksha-Yoga. They are: Akhantaram, Daksha Takharam, Khetaram, Khiet-Shirani, Varuna, Prithivi, Yayuram and Agni Daksha. Khetaram suggests the possibility of evolving the rest of humanity. Agni Daksha supports an exterminationist agenda. So far, the other Dhyani have made no statement on the matter.<div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>Daksha history begins with Kurt Eisler, a young Obrimos mage from southern Germany and a politically prominent (if not highly skilled) member of the Mysterium. Eisler became fascinated with various esoteric groups that grew from Western interpretations of Hinduism. Eisler’s enthusiasm eventually took him to India. When Eisler returned in 1891, he possessed a third eye on the back of his head, and was no longer only a “he.” This new Eisler adopted the shadow name of Daksha Takharam, and claimed he had found the legendary realm of Shambhalla. There, he met with a spiritually advanced being called Kuut Humi. This entity vouchsafed to him a complete text of the ancient Stanzas of Dzyan. In the Stanzas, the young mage found a prophecy of the second rising of Atlantis. Kuut Humi told Eisler that he could shape the evolutionary destiny of the human race, and instructed the mage in the principles of Daksha-Yoga.</div><div>Daksha Takharam later explained that Daksha-Yoga was created by an Atlantean archmage named Daksha. This archmage transformed himself/herself into the synthesis of all previous stages of human evolution. Since human evolution is cyclical, Daksha also anticipated every subsequent evolutionary stage. Through a year and a day of Daksha’s meditations, Eisler developed a third eye and became an androgyne.</div><div>Daksha Takharam gathered seven disciples, all German, British or American members of the Mysterium. The eight of them returned to India, where they founded an ashram in Madras. Under Daksha Takharam’s direction, each disciple contacted another Atlantean Master. Within 10 years, these eight began to take on pupils of their own. Later, the Dhyanis sent their pupils into the West to recover Atlantean lore and artifacts, and to make new Awakened converts.</div><div>The Daksha grew slowly but steadily. Most recruits came from the Mysterium. At the end of World War I, the Daksha Dhyanis left Madras for parts unknown. They claimed that the Great War had caused a psychic storm of such intensity that they needed constant seclusion for meditations to quell the emanations. For all intents and purposes, they vanished. From then on, the Dhyanis communicated with their pupils through scrying windows, dreams and astral projections. Occasionally, a Dhyan would turn up unexpectedly in Madras, ostensibly to check up on his/her pupils; these visits became more infrequent over the years. The last time any Daksha met a Dhyan in person was in 1938. Still, the Legacy enjoyed considerable prestige through its claim to be led by actual archmasters.</div><div>During World War II, the Dhyanis supported the Nazis, who held somewhat similar theories about racial superiority and human evolution. The Dhyanis said that the Nazi eugenic experiment would improve human stock in preparation for the Coming Race. After the war, however, almost no Daksha would admit their Legacy had ever approved of the Nazis in any way. (But then, they had a lot of company among Sleepers. Plenty of intellectuals supported eugenics right up to the liberation of the death camps.) Daksha recruitment dropped off sharply after World War II and only recovered during the late ’60s, as the New Age movement took off.</div><div>The Legacy’s poor choice in friends wasn’t the only blow to Daksha prestige. The reliability of the Dhyanis and the Masters is also increasingly in doubt, even among the Legacy’s younger members.</div><div>In 1903, the Masters predicted that Atlantis would rise in 1946. The Dhyanis also relayed predictions that Atlantis would return in 1967, 1980 and 1999. No one’s seen any lost continents reappear lately. Seemingly unconcerned, each time, the Dhyanis have simply issued another target date. (This time, they say Atlantis will rise on December 21, 2012).</div><div>A growing number of Daksha wonder if the Masters and the Dhyanis really know what they are doing. The Dhyanis still send messages from their place of seclusion, but no one has seen a Dhyan face-to-face for more than 60 years. If Daksha Takharam is still alive, he/she must be over 130 years old — possible for a master of Life magic, but not a sure thing, either. Where are Daksha Takharam and his/her disciples? Are they even still alive?</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Masters</h3></div><div>Are the Masters really Oracles? If not, who are they? The Dhyanis keep their silence when asked. Perhaps they don’t know the truth themselves.</div><div>Each Dhyan has his/her own Master who communicates exclusively with him/her. If the all Dhyanis are honest, apparently the Masters are not of one mind (for example, on the question of how the evolution of humanity should progress, which is hardly insignificant). They’re not all that reliable, either, having falsely predicted the rising of Atlantis four times so far. One would think that Oracles could do better. So, who are they? Some Daksha have suspicions they prefer not to voice, for fear of expulsion from the Legacy. Still, nothing stops them thinking (at the moment), and the Legacy includes many skilled investigators. Whether the Daksha’s leaders will allow the truth to come out is another question.</div><div>Some members of the Mysterium rather unkindly suggest that the Masters may be demons or spirits attempting to control a group of mages for their own purposes. Maybe the recovery of Atlantean artifacts serves some infernal agenda. Maybe the “secret masters” want just one particular artifact recovered, after which point they’ll cut the Daksha loose. Maybe the Masters are just doing it for laughs. But if the Dhyanis are archmages, wouldn’t they see through a demon’s deceptions?</div><div>If the Masters are not spirits or ascended Atlanteans, what else could they be? Ancient vampires using telepathic powers? Mad gods? Aliens? None of these really seem probable, but again, colleagues of the Daksha within the Mysterium sometimes make the suggestions.</div><div>The Exarchs are possible candidates. This theory, first suggested by a disenchanted Daksha some 20 years ago, suggests that the Legacy is all a plot to divide the Awakened and precipitate a war between them, with the Daksha as a catalyst. But, surely, the Exarchs are more subtle than to use a group of three-eyed hermaphrodites as their pawns?</div><div>Perhaps the Daksha’s leaders are right, and the Masters really are Oracles. But that raises a more disturbing question: are the Oracles fallible?</div><div>Some Daksha nurse doubts that the Masters exist at all. Maybe the Dhyanis are deluded, they say, or just making the Masters up. If the Dhyanis were making the Masters up, though, wouldn’t the archmages try to tell a more consistent story? Anyway, no one’s seen a Dhyan face-to-face in decades. What if the problem isn’t the Masters? What if the Dhyanis are no longer whoever they say they are?</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>The Daksha believe they know how to recover Atlantis. Their leaders hold the answers. Their founders commune with Oracles. The Daksha possess the key to bring back Atlantis and the rule of the Awakened. And, of course, the Daksha are one step more evolved than everyone else. Their colleagues in the Mysterium think Advent mages are arrogant and condescending, but, at the same time, the Mysterium members respect the sheer volume of knowledge the Daksha have uncovered. Members of other orders who meet the Daksha often feel the same way, to a greater or lesser degree.</div><div>Despite the Advent hierarchical structure, individual Daksha are usually left free to pursue their own agendas. After the amount of training (and indoctrination) they’ve been through, their leaders trust that members will serve the Legacy’s agenda in one way or another — and most do.</div><div>All Daksha must answer to their regional cabals, but, most of the time, they can choose their own activities. Every Daksha is expected to follow the pronouncements of the Dhyanis and the Masters — but the Dhyanis’ words are vague and inconsistent enough that Daksha can usually concoct an interpretation that justifies whatever they want to do anyway.</div><div>The lack of real oversight by the Dhyanis often leads to disagreements among their followers. Rival factions of Daksha may wage little wars against each other as they compete for caches of Atlantean magic. Daksha whose quest for Atlantean lore bear fruit are more likely to gain status and the favor of their superiors.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Manners</h3><div>Daksha often find they must work with mages inferior to themselves — namely, everyone who isn’t part of the Advent. Like many people who base their lives on spiritual certainties, Daksha often can’t understand why anyone wouldn’t want to be like them; refusal to join the Advent suggests ignorance at best, a failure of intelligence or morals at worst.</div><div>Most Daksha are sensible enough to know they have to work with other people. The Daksha may think those who are not willing to evolve are destined for the dustbin of history; but, just as an evangelical Christian who secretly believes his friends are destined for Hell, the Daksha are smart enough to know when not to preach. They practice a kind of selective blindness. For the sake of their relationships, they act as if their non-Daksha friends are Daksha, too. Maybe if the Daksha set a good example, their friends will see the light and join the Advent.</div><div>Of course, some mages aren’t friends. The Daksha still try to meet insults and accusations with good manners. The doctrines of Daksha-Yoga say that outward serenity reflects inward grace. Daksha can be condescending, arrogant or hostile, but even when they’re informing other mages of their inferiority, dismissing their colleagues’ opinions or dispensing threats, the Daksha are always unfailingly nice. They keep strange, serene smiles on their faces and never raise their voices. Daksha never use obscenity, foul language or rude names. They say “please” and “thank you.” As a result, they get away with acts that would bring censure on less diplomatic mages. Quite often, people might hear what a Daksha says but fail to grasp its import, because how can someone so polite be planning to kill most of humanity? Including you?</div><div>Sometimes, opponents of the Advent underestimate them as shallow lotus-eaters, crackpots too blissed-out to pose a threat. On the other hand, mages can just as easily overestimate the Daksha’s skills: they look like they know more and wield greater powers than they really do.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Stanzas of Dzyan</h3><div>Most of the Daksha’s doctrines come from a small book of blank verse called the Stanzas of Dzyan. Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society, claimed she channeled the text and published fragments in The Secret Doctrine, with a great deal of her own commentary. Sleeper scholars say Blavatsky cribbed her Stanza excerpts from the Rig-Veda and other Hindu scriptures, filtered through her own magpie occultism and imagination. That didn’t stop hundreds of thousands of Sleepers from joining the Theosophical Society, the religion Blavatsky created to institutionalize her doctrine. The Mysterium studied The Secret Doctrine immediately after its publication. They assured other mages that Madame Blavatsky didn’t have a clue about the Mysteries and there was never any such book as the Stanzas of Dzyan.</div><div>Fifteen years later, Daksha Takharam revealed his/her version of the Stanzas. The Daksha’s book generally follows Blavatsky’s mythology, but is more complete than her fragments and somewhat less opaque. Everything the Daksha believe about human prehistory is spelled out in High Speech. Each copy is traditionally written on a number of palm leaves in golden ink. Daksha tutors require their pupils to scribe their own copies of the Stanzas before they complete the first attainment of Daksha-Yoga.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Seven Root Races</h3><div>According to the Stanzas of Dzyan, the human race is locked into an evolutionary cycle. Humanity did not evolve from lower primates. Rather, the Cosmic One emanated creatures destined to evolve through seven Root Races before returning to the Cosmic One and beginning again. Furthermore, each Root Race has seven sub-races that evolve, one from the other, but which can co-exist and inter-breed for a time.</div><div>This cycle has happened before and will happen again. This time around, however, the cycle has gone wrong, with the sinking of Atlantis as just one consequence. In the Daksha’s version of Theosophical history, the seven races have been, are and (if the cycle is repaired) will be the following:</div><div><b>The First Root Race:</b> Astral beings made of pure energy. These “Children of the Fire Mist” condensed as their subraces progressed, until they evolved into...</div><div><b>The Second Root Race:</b> Huge amorphous beings, souls without consciousnesses. In each subsequent sub-race, these beings shrank and developed limbs and bodily definition, to become...</div><div><b>The Third Root Race:</b> The hermaphrodite, three-eyed, otherwise human inhabitants of Atlantis’ precursor, Lemuria. At first, the Lemurians lived in a state of innocence and grace, guided by Supernal wisdom received through the third eye. The second sub-race of the Lemurians fell when, in an attempt to pre-empt evolution, they gained Arcane knowledge before they were destined to do so. An evolutionary cataclysm happened. The Lemurians split into genders ahead of their evolutionary schedule. Eventually, the Lemurians became...</div><div><b>The Fourth Root Race:</b> This race began as the gigantic, blue-skinned Rmoahals who later became the Atlanteans, the fulcrum of the human evolutionary cycle. The Atlanteans built the Watchtowers and codified magic. They learned how to use Mana (or as they called it, “Vril” ) as a power source for advanced magical technologies and terrible weapons. They were still crippled, incomplete beings, however. Their own pride ended the Atlantean dream, forcing an exodus and sending the Watchtowers beyond the physical world. The exiles evolved into...</div><div><b>The Fifth Root Race:</b> True humanity as we know it. In their commentaries on the Stanzas, the Dhyanis divide humanity into separate sub-races, some evolutionarily superior to others. Officially, the Aryans (that is, Caucasians and people of northern India) are the latest evolutionary stage. By Daksha reckoning, they are the sixth sub-race of the Fifth Root, and hence the only candidates for further evolution. In the developed West, most Daksha are uncomfortable with the racist aspect of their philosophy. However, a significant — and powerful — minority believe in the racism and use it to justify their attitude towards “lesser” humans.</div><div>The Daksha say that by using magic to recover androgyny and the third eye, they can steer the evolutionary cycle back to its original course. When the world holds enough re-evolved humans, Atlantis will rise from the ocean. The remnants of the lesser human races will be made obsolete. The new Atlanteans will evolve into the seventh sub-race, who will all be Awakened. Their third eyes will see into the Supernal World, and the breach in the cycle caused by the Atlanteans’ arrogance will be repaired. Then the cycle can continue, with the appearance of...</div><div><b>The Sixth Root Race:</b> Beings so attuned with the Supernal World that they will begin to fade from the material realm. Eventually, they will lose even the semblance of human form, becoming...</div><div><b>The Seventh Root Race:</b> Entirely astral beings who will grow so in touch with the Supernal Realm that individual identity and thought will become unnecessary. When the last trace of human individuality has faded into Oneness and has been absorbed into the Supernal Realm, the cycle will begin again.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Atlantean Artifacts</h3><div>The Daksha seem to have great success in unearthing relics of Atlantis, including artifacts they say came from Lemuria. (Most mages don’t believe Lemuria ever existed. The Daksha reply that most Sleepers don’t believe Atlantis ever existed.) The Legacy’s archeologists hunt such relics at an increasingly frantic rate — and find them. Daksha leaders say this is a sign that Atlantis is ready to rise. More cynical Mysterium mages suggested it’s a sign that the Daksha have hired some reliable artisans: the craftsmen of Egypt, Southeast Asia and Central America are notoriously skilled forgers of antiquities. Most of the ancient objects the Daksha hand over to the Mysterium are only of cultural interest — potsherds and coins, fragmentary tablets and tableware, brooches, buttons, hairslides and combs. They may bear sigils in High Speech but have no magical properties.</div><div>Every so often, someone uncovers an object of true value: a document carved on stone or metal tablets, an Imbued item or even a true Artifact. Many Daksha will resort to anything to get their hands on such items. Most of these Atlantean items require an infusion of Mana to work. A newly discovered magical treasure might retain one or two points of Mana in its reservoir, but most have none and need to be charged.</div><div>The Daksha have found a few fragments of what they believe are Atlantean flying machines. They have yet to find their Holy Grail, a complete working Vimana — a flying machine armed with weapons the like of which the world has tried to forget for 5,000 years. Likewise, no one has found a Brahmastra, reputedly the ultimate weapon of the heroes of Atlantis. If anyone were to find either of these weapons, the various factions of the Daksha would begin a desperate race to seize them. What happens next depends on the faction who gets the item. Some Daksha would destroy an Atlantean superweapon as a leftover from the pride that destroyed Atlantis and broke the cosmos. Some Daksha would hide the weapon and study it. Others would freely use it as part of their great plan to clear the Earth of un-evolved humanity, in line with prophecy from the Stanzas of Dzyan.</div><div style='margin: 15px;'><h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Atlantean Fire Crystal (Imbued Item •••••)</h3><p>Durability 3, Size 1, Structure 4</p><p>Mana Capacity: 11</p><p>During the last 10 years, the Daksha have found several Atlantean Fire Crystals. The Daksha believe the Atlanteans used these reddish, fist-sized crystals as a power source for other magical devices or perhaps even to supply light and heat for Atlantean homes.</p><p>When energized, the crystal duplicates the Prime 3 spell “Ley Lines.” Some crystals are imbued with other magic powers; other crystals are found with stands or cases, inscribed in High Speech.</p></div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction </h2><div>In the Western world, most Daksha are fervent evangelists. While the prospect of becoming a three-eyed hermaphrodite might not appeal to most mages, the Advent offers several benefits.</div><div>The Daksha give the impression that they know awesome, mighty secrets. Never mind that they harp on every advantage they can, make copies of their scripture for every single member of the Legacy and loan them out to any mage who expresses an interest. It doesn’t matter: a Daksha only has to hint that he/she could say much more if he/she wanted. The sheer detail and extravagance of Daksha mythology lends it verisimilitude. How can a Daksha be wrong, when he/she can rattle off the names of Atlantean cities and kings and describe daily life in Lemuria? And the Legacy does show great skill at finding Atlantean relics.</div><div>The Daksha future, too, holds an ominous glamour. Join us, they say. Rule with us in a paradise where your power will be absolute. Hold the key to magics you cannot dream of! Become a superman, greater even than other mages! The reality might be a little different — or non-existent — but, despite the dubious status of their leaders, the Daksha seem so sure of their destiny. Their sheer confidence can attract mages — especially the forceful Obrimos — in a World of Darkness where so little is certain.</div><div>Finally, there’s the sex. The Daksha are beautiful. They’ll tell you that they know how to do things with their bodies that humans simply can’t. The Daksha are beyond male and female, gay and straight, and they are taught to use their bodies to their greatest potential. They say they can experience heights of ecstasy that the single-gendered literally can’t imagine. This tactic pulled in a lot of converts back in the ’60s, and still meets with a fair degree of success, especially in Western Europe. In the end, the promises of wild hermaphrodite sex can’t be the only reason a convert joins (especially when the new apprentice learns he actually must remain celibate until he achieves true androgyny) — but the promise of great sex gets other mages listening, and that’s a start.</div><div>When a Daksha finds a willing convert, the Daksha takes the prospective apprentice to the Advent’s tutor, and asks the tutor to take the other mage as a pupil. While Daksha tutors rarely turn down a mage who meets the Legacy’s requirements, Daksha-Yoga takes a long time to learn. The apprentice must adopt a strict vegan diet, take vows of chastity and poverty and follow the Legacy’s meditative exercises for hours each day. When the recruit learns enough of the basic principles, she shaves her head and retreats to a cell. There, under the instruction of the tutor, she adopts a meditation position and enters a trance. The meditation lasts three days straight, with no food or water, while the recruit crafts her soul according to the guidelines in the Stanzas of Dzyan, with her tutor’s help. Students often gather at a regional cabal’s ashram and undergo their initiations at the same time.</div><div>During the early days of the Legacy, one Daksha initiate in four died of starvation without ever waking up. These days, Daksha tutors are more soft-hearted (and more reluctant to lose Willpower for nothing). Most tutors stop the rite if they think prospective apprentices will fail and die. If the initiate succeeds, he wakes from her trance with a third eye in the back of her head.</div><div>The second attainment requires long practice at breath and body control, and a similar ordeal. When the tutor thinks the apprentice is ready, the junior Daksha again shaves her head and retreats to a cell. The tutor puts her in a trance and watches over her as the pupil’s body undergoes further changes. This time, the trance lasts a week. The Daksha becomes double-gendered. The vow of chastity lapses; otherwise, all the rules of Daksha-Yoga remain in force. The Daksha isn’t halfway between both genders or sexless. He/she becomes wholly male and wholly female at the same time. His/her personality changes to reflect his/her new state. The Daksha is in perfect harmony. He/she feels fantastic, better than he/she ever did before. He/she quite reasonably thinks that other mages should want to feel like this, and starts spreading the word if he/she didn’t before.</div><div>The third attainment requires a deeper trance than any before and a profound physiological shock. This might involve hanging suspended by hooks through the Daksha’s skin, piercing his/her flesh with knives and skewers or some similar mortification of the flesh. Again, the tutor places the pupil into a trance; this time, the Daksha refines his/her body to such a level that he/she becomes truly superhuman.</div><div>All the while that the Daksha gather the experience and skill necessary to undergo each initiation, they are expected to practice the necessary disciplines of body and spirit needed to prepare for the next stage: meditation, yogic exercise and, during the later stages, Tantric practices and ordeals of pain.</div><div style='margin: 15px’><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;’>Initiation Mechanics </h3> <div>When a mage undergoes the Daksha initiation, her player must roll Stamina + Resolve. If the roll succeeds, the character becomes a Daksha with the suitable attainment. If the roll fails, the tutor steps in and stops the rite. The character can try again after more training, when the tutor thinks the character is ready, which could be a few weeks or a whole year.</div><div>The Storyteller can, if she wants, simply rule that the mage survives — and someone else who goes through the ordeal at the same time doesn’t.</div></div><h3 style='margin-bottom: 0';>Bacchajudagaras</h3><div>The ruling cabal of the Daksha still controls the Legacy from Chennai, and India still boasts the greatest number of Daksha. India has one-sixth of the world’s population, mostly Hindu, and a cultural framework that legitimates magic, altered states of consciousness and the notion of a transcendent reality beyond the physical world: India produces a lot of mages.</div><div>Some of India’s mages Awaken very young. The Daksha see these bacchajudagaras (“child-mages”) as a crucial part of their order. Daksha proselytes do their utmost to bring as many child-mages as they can into the Advent. The children’s parents, dazzled by promises of their children’s glorious future, readily give their offspring to the Advent. If religious persuasion doesn’t work, money usually sways poorer families. When all else fails, the Daksha fall back on kidnapping. The Daksha don’t care about a child-mage’s Path, an exception to their usual restriction to fellow Obrimos or Mysterium.</div><div>The Daksha keep their bacchajudagaras at the Chennai ashram, where tutors drill them in the disciplines of Daksha-Yoga all day, every day. The tutors constantly remind their charges that they’re special, but allow them no rest, no holidays and no childhood. The bacchajudagaras’ years of intense studies sometimes bring the more talented among them as far as the second attainment of Daksha-Yoga before they reach 20 years of age. They are all promising mages, but the Legacy also turns most of them into frustrated, damaged individuals who know nothing about ordinary, human life. Some bacchajudagaras envy Sleepers for their thoughtless lives; other bacchajudagaras hate Sleepers. </div>",

Through the rigors of training, she also begins to refine her body. Her skin becomes smoother, muscles become stronger and more supple, and body hair, but not head hair, begins to thin and fade away. The mage becomes able to access the benefits of the Life 2 spell “Body Control” at any time.<div>The third eye has the potential for great things. At this stage, however, the Daksha can merely use the third eye as an extra eye. When the eye is open and uncovered, she can see in every direction, front and back, with an effect similar to the Space 1 spell “Omnivision.” When closed, the perfectly round eye is still fairly obvious. Many Daksha grow their hair long to cover the eye, or wear hats, scarves or turbans. All spells involving sight perception (such as all the versions of Mage Sight) work just as well out of the third eye as they do from the normal two.</div>",

        "secondAttainmentDescription": "<div>A Daksha awakens from the second initiatory trance as a hermaphrodite, gaining the primary sexual characteristics of both genders. A male Daksha becomes shorter and slimmer, with a higher voice and a more delicate neck and jaw line. His Adam’s apple shrinks, and he gains small breasts. His genitalia move slightly, and he gains a vagina and womb underneath his testes. A female Daksha experiences analogous but opposite changes.</div><div>With some concentration, the Daksha can temporarily become either sex more completely, with an effect similar to the Life 3 spell, “Transform Self.” This is sometimes useful in that all three forms the Daksha can take — male, female and hermaphrodite — look distinctly different. The gendered forms don’t just look like the other forms in drag. A casual observer, particularly a Sleeper, might notice the resemblance between a Daksha’s male form, female form and hermaphrodite form (perhaps thinking, “Hey, she could be the sister of that guy I met this morning”) — but few people would immediately think the three forms are the same person.</div><div>(The Storyteller might call for a Wits + Composure roll for a character to notice the similarity between forms, but only an exceptional success would let someone suspect that two forms are the same person — and a Sleeper probably Disbelieves at once. If a player suspects that male and female characters are the same gender-switching person, however, the Storyteller should not insist the character would not think such a thing.)</div><div>Daksha breed true. A Daksha can procreate with anyone — single-gendered, ordinary humans, other hermaphrodites or even with himself/ herself. The children of any such union, no matter who the mother, will themselves be hermaphrodites. The offspring lack the third eye, though; they are at a transitional stage between human and the Coming Race. Hermaphrodite children born in Western hospitals are normally assigned genders as a matter of routine practice, with surgery to enforce the decision. Daksha parents have, through painful experience, learned to make sure they are present when their babies are born, to forestall the doctors. The second attainment is really the point of no return.A Daksha’s own family and friends won’t recognize him/her after he/she has undergone this transformation.</div>",

        "descrizione": "<div>These days, people think of faerie stories as harmless children’s tales, all Prince Charming and faerie godmothers turning pumpkins into coaches. All too often, mages see the Acanthus as fitting into that same mold — mercurial, but ultimately harmless and good-hearted. The Daoine remember the truths behind those stories, when princes weren’t charmers but blood-soaked warriors and when wicked queens danced in red-hot iron boots until they died. Justice is the Daoine’s calling; through their mastery of the Fate Arcanum, they offer vengeance to the wronged and justice to those the world seems to pass by. The Daoine are the deus ex machina at the end of the faerie tale, the twist of fate that ensures that the wicked stepsisters’ eyes are plucked out by white doves and the woodsman’s axe is freshly sharpened when he goes to check on the ruckus at grandma’s house.</div><div>The Daoine (pronounced DEE-nee or THEE-na) are usually less frivolous and impulsive than their brethren on the Path of Thistle — or at least, the stereotype attached to their fellow Acanthus. The Daoine emulate the high courts of the Fae: the sidhe lords of the British Isles are their exemplars, and the Daoine comport themselves with the solemn, ethereal grace of Arcadia’s lords. Most Daoine adhere to a strong code of etiquette, instilled in them by their tutors, and put great stock in proper behavior. A crass or boorish individual finds it much harder to secure a Daoine’s aid than someone who is gracious, polite and respectful.</div><div>The exact code of hospitality varies from mage to mage. Some Daoine put great stock in old tales of mortal dealings with the Fair Folk. Other Daoine expect the formal decorum of Victorian gentry, Islamic hospitality or good old-fashioned American neighborliness.</div><div>Anyone who thinks the Daoine are nothing but Miss Manners with Supernal knowledge would make a  grave mistake. The Good Folk (so nicknamed because, like the faeries the Daoine imitate, to call them by an unkind name may invite their wrath) bring justice. Not the common justice of putting a murderer behind bars or returning a stolen car, but the justice of the Fae, little remembered now outside of faerie tales and folklore. Few mages command such a mastery of hexes and curses as the Daoine, and few are as willing — some might say eager — to employ them. Many Daoine take particular glee in drawing upon the old faerie tales for inspiration in their methods: abusive parents who lock their child in the basement find themselves trapped in a crashed car whose doors won’t open and whose windows won’t break, sinking into the water, or a murderer slips and falls in the same incinerator he used to dispose of the evidence.</div><div>Some Daoine serve the Awakened community as hexers-for-hire, agents of fate who redress grievances between mages — for the right price. Every action has an equal reaction, the Daoine reason, and, likewise, every accomplishment requires a sacrifice of some sort. Other members of this Legacy show more altruistic motives, punishing those who criminals the Sleeper authorities cannot or will not prosecute. Those individuals who exploit children, whether for labor, sex or merely the thrill of dominating another human being, are especially likely to draw a Daoine’s ire: the Good Folk despise those who abuse the human race’s most helpless members.</div><div>In many ways, the Daoine are relics of an older time, when justice was harsh and mercy rare. The Good Folk see their duty as the balancing hand of fate, ensuring that good and evil receive their just deserts. To this end, Daoine also use their mastery of Fate in beneficial ways. Some rewards are quickly arranged: a Daoine sees a man give a lady his seat on the bus; later that evening, the gentleman finds $50 in the gutter. Other times, the Daoine put as much careful thought and effort into rewarding the just as punishing the wicked. In keeping with the Daoine’s belief in a karmic balance, many Daoine would like to bestow as many rewards as punishments. Sadly, in the World of Darkness, they are called upon for the latter much more often than the former.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Good Folk",
        "orders": "Most Daoine find themselves drawn to the Adamantine Arrow or the Guardians of the Veil, depending upon the individual’s personality. Daoine of the Arrow are often the most forthright, using their curses to right wrongs and punish the wicked. They often serve in a support capacity, using their mastery of Fate magic to hinder their enemies both directly (causing attacks to go awry and defenses to fail) and indirectly (disrupting enemy supply lines and communications). Daoine in the ranks of the Guardians of the Veil focus less on punishing the wicked and more on punishing the transgressions of their fellow mages. The Daoine are often fanatical in their devotion to upholding the strictest possible secrecy, and have a not-wholly-undeserved reputation for overkill in dealing with mages who expose Sleepers to the Awakened world.<div>Silver Ladder Daoine most commonly fit the “vengeance-broker” stereotype, trading their mystical punishments for tass, magical artifacts or even filthy lucre. Relatively few Daoine join the Mysterium and the Free Council. Mysterium members are often too bound up in their search for knowledge to worry about how that knowledge might upset the balance of fate, while Free Council members lack the reverence for the old ways and traditions that the Daoine cling to.</div>",
        "appearance": "Not all Daoine are physically beautiful, but they often possess a magnetic presence and lordly mien that commands respect and reverence. They dress impeccably, usually in the most expensive styles their budgets can afford. Daoine sometimes show a subtly ethereal or “fey” air about them, which sometimes manifests as oddly-colored eyes, unusually long, supple hands and fingers or slightly pointed, elfin ears. Some Daoine come by this appearance naturally, while others (usually younger Daoine) consider it fashionable to subtly alter their appearance with the Life Arcanum. Such features become especially pronounced when a Daoine shows her nimbus.",
        "background": "Daoine share a strong belief in justice, as both an abstract concept and as a natural law (what goes around, comes around). Even before Awakening, these men and women believed there was, or should be, a cosmic force ensuring that each person gets what he or she deserves in the end. Some Daoine are calmly philosophical about this concept, while others rail passionately about the wrongness of the world when confronted with perceived injustices. Even those Daoine who do not necessarily believe that a higher power metes out cosmic justice usually hold strong notions about how the world should be, even if it seldom seems to work that way. Awakened police officers, utopian dreamers and civil-rights crusaders are likely to pursue the Daoine Legacy.<div>Mages who ask a Daoine to right a personal wrong sometimes come to see the greater injustices in the world and take this Legacy’s mantle themselves. These mages can become the most passionate and determined to complete their training; after all, no one is more zealous than a new convert.</div><div>Sometimes, for no readily discernible reason, a mage is simply chosen by destiny to become a Daoine, whether he wants to be one or not. Master Daoine are drawn to such students and may employ extreme tactics such as kidnapping or blackmail to coerce the students into beginning their training. Conversely, sometimes a Daoine finds himself compelled by Fate to tutor a mage who wants to join the Legacy — no matter how unlikely the recruit seems at first glance.</div>",
        "organizzation": "The Daoine usually operate alone, or with their tutors in the case of younger, less-experienced mages. Relationships between tutors and students are either extraordinarily long-lasting or quickly and bitterly ended, with very little in between. Some Daoine recognize the sacred bonds of respect and deference that link student to teacher: these Daoine typically maintain cordial relationships with their teachers long after the apprenticeships are ended. Unfortunately, the personalities attracted to the Daoine Legacy often dislike abasing themselves. These mages tolerate subservience just long enough to learn what they feel they need from their mentors, then burn their bridges with startling alacrity and depart. These Daoine seldom progress to their third attainment: Good Folk who betray a trust and a contract show they don’t understand one of the Legacy’s most important precepts.<div>Now and then, Daoine come together in cabals of three called Moirae, after the Fates of Greek mythology. Moirae sometimes come together out of happenstance, but most often one mage decides that a particular task is too great to handle alone. She puts out a subtle call through the webs of Fate that brings a Moirae together. Daoine refer to this process as “drawing threes,” and often use Tarot cards or similar divinatory tools to gain insight into the natures of their companions. Members of a Moirae often find they were already working on the same problem from different angles or in different locations. </div><div>Traditionally, each member of a Moirae fills a specific role and brings knowledge of a specific Arcanum to the group, though, in modern times, this tradition is optional. One member, referred to as Clotho (or sometimes the Clotho; Daoine differ on whether the roles are meant as names or titles), studies Life magic. The second, Lachesis, is expected to have skill with Time. Finally, the Atropos delves into the ends of all things and studies Death. When the youngest and oldest mages can take the roles of Clotho and Atropos, the Daoine consider it an extremely good omen. Despite the thematic links with the Greek Fates, men are not discouraged or prohibited from joining Moirae.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>The customs and attainments of this Legacy date back thousands of years; nobody knows where and when they began. “Daoine” itself is a Gaelic word for the faerie-folk. However, some mages trace the Legacy’s name to Athena, whom the Greeks called Goddess of Just Deserts and companion of the Fates. Other mages trace the Daoine to the djinni of Arab legend. Most modern Daoine, however, say their Legacy has no distinct origin. They were fated to exist; and they shall endure as long as Fate decrees.</div><div>The Daoine Legacy certainly existed in the British Isles as long as the Celtic people themselves. As British influence spread from the 17th to the 19th centuries, this tiny Legacy spread as well and encountered similar (and equally ancient) Legacies that shared their philosophy of justice and vengeance: the Greek Moirae of Athena, the Scandinavian Norns, disciples of Raven and Coyote in the New World and others. The Victorian belief in British superiority extended to Awakened Britons. Even though the predominantly Scottish and Irish Daoine had their own historic experience of oppression, some hubris-ridden Daoine tried to absorb their “errant cousins” abroad. A few brief but intense wizards’ wars all ended badly. By the close of the 19th century, the militant mages on all sides met colorful dooms at each others’ hands.</div><div>The surviving Daoine let Fate itself decide their future. Their divinations told them to make peace. Other Legacies received similar advice. The European Legacies formalized their union at the ancient oracular cave of Delphi; they drew lots for the composite Legacy’s name, and “Daoine” won. The Legacy now draws its images, jargon and practices equally from Greek, Norse and Celtic traditions. The new Daoine became the dominant Legacy of justice-dealers in the Western world.</div><div>Similar Legacies from non-European cultures remain independent. These smaller, parallel Legacies still hold grudges from the colonial era. In the new millennium, however, some quasi-Daoine show new interest in cooperation. Several times during the last few years, Daoine assembling a Moirae have been led to Indian, Middle Eastern or Native American mages. Who are the Daoine to argue with Fate?</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>The Daoine are an insular bunch. Their unusual sense of propriety and etiquette makes other mages leery of socializing with the Daoine too closely. For the most part, the Daoine don’t mind this at all. Few outside their own Legacy truly understand the importance of proper decorum, after all. Daoine tend to hold themselves aloof from the rest of mage society, paying lip service at best to the Consilii and operating as mavericks (they would say, “impartial observers”). This attitude may cause conflict with the Sentinels, who (perhaps rightly) see the Daoine as dangerous wildcards in mage society. Even Daoine who recognize the rule of a Consilium are often watched closely by its Sentinels, whether they deserve the scrutiny or not. Ironically, those Daoine who become Sentinels often become frighteningly good at their job.</div><div>The core philosophy that unites the Daoine is one of balance, of a karmic harmony that punishes vice and rewards virtue. In this, they share certain beliefs with the Obrimos, but where the Theurgists focus on doing good works, the Daoine emphasize punishment for those who do ill. The Daoine call this balance the Scales of Wyrd, but that analogy is a gross oversimplification. Every life, and every action that affects a single life, also affects countless others in ways both great and small. The Scales are not merely a balance of right versus wrong, but a vast spiderweb of interconnected strands, where pushing even slightly on one changes the balance of thousands or millions of others.</div><div>The sheer complexity of the Scales inevitably creates conflict between Daoine. Even masters of Fate magic cannot read an action’s full impact on the Scales, and each Daoine’s personal bias influences his view of the proper means to put things right. Moirae serve as a check on intra-Legacy conflict; when all three members reach the same judgment, they can be sure they have read the Scales right and their intervention will serve the greater balance.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>The path to becoming a Daoine is a long and arduous one, and few have the requisite mindset to complete it successfully. Daoine are notoriously harsh toward their students, driving them mercilessly with meaningless tasks, exhausting chores and constant belittlement. This is done not out of spite (at least, not most of the time), but rather to impress upon the aspirant that his current place in the Scales is a lowly one, and if he is to prove worthy of the lofty place of a Daoine, he must fully comprehend the place of all things, from the highest to the lowest. Assuming the prospective Daoine survives the grueling initiation, things only get worse.</div><div>The typical induction into the Daoine involves the aspirant locating one of the Good Folk and petitioning for tutelage. The seeker is promptly ignored, sometimes for hours, sometimes days or weeks. This technique is most popular with Daoine who make their homes in harsh climates—bitterly cold mountains, sweltering deserts and so on. Daoine in more temperate regions favor setting the applicant to menial tasks that in no way involve magic: maintaining the grounds outside the sanctum, running errands and similar mundane tasks that keep the apprentice out of the tutor’s sanctum (or wherever the tutor calls home). The exact method varies, but the point is to test the apprentice’s determination to join the Daoine. An apprentice who gives up and departs before being allowed into the tutor’s home is dismissed as unworthy and never again given the opportunity to join.</div><div>At some point, once the tutor is convinced of the apprentice’s determination, the Daoine’s doors are opened and the apprentice is permitted to enter. This is an occasion fraught with significance for the Good Folk — even if the apprentice has briefly been inside the mage’s home or sanctum (for example, to deliver a package or receive instructions), this is considered to be her first admittance into her tutor’s home. The apprentice is treated as an honored guest and welcomed with a ritual of hospitality the tutor considers appropriate. Depending upon the tutor and the apprentice, this ritual may be as formal as a Japanese tea ceremony or as informal as a few beers and a football game. Most Daoine choose rituals that will make their apprentices comfortable, but if the apprentices have been persistently annoying or disrespectful during the first portion of the training, the tutors may deliberately choose rituals of hospitality that will make the apprentices feel out of their element. Regardless of the nature of the ritual, it is the last kindness an apprentice can expect from her tutor for quite some time.</div><div>Once the apprentice has been formally accepted, her tutelage begins. She undergoes rigorous training in uses of the Fate Arcanum, in addition to studying the Arcana of Time and Space. At this point in the apprentice’s initiation, she is not taught the famous hexes the Legacy is known for; her instruction focuses on the ability to read the Scales of Wyrd and understand the place of all things within it. Most tutors sequester their charges for the duration of this first portion of training, but some, especially traveling Daoine, take their apprentices “into the field” so that they might learn to see and understand the Scales in the real world. The menial chores do not abate during this period of the apprentice’s instruction, though their purpose has changed from testing the apprentice’s determination to ingraining in her the knowledge that her station is below her tutor’s.</div><div>Once the apprentice has achieved the Legacy’s first attainment, she embarks on the next stage of her teaching. She knows how to read the complex weaving of the Scales of Wyrd; now she learns how to sense transgressors against the Scales and how to punish them for upsetting the order of the cosmos. Once the apprentice has mastered the first attainment, she is considered a Daoine proper, albeit a low-ranking apprentice whose word may be gainsaid without question by any Daoine of higher rank. As the apprentice works toward mastery of the second attainment, her menial duties decrease in favor of more esoteric study. She often accompanies her tutor in the investigation of disruptions to the natural order, serving as an aide-de-camp or secondary investigator. If the apprentice’s tutor trains multiple apprentices, this apprentice might be put in charge of one or more lower-ranked students.</div><div>Tutors suggest that apprentices should use their free time to look for chances to punish the wicked and reward the virtuous. Apprentices are encouraged to keep their interventions small and subtle until they learn to read the Scales of Wyrd, but an apprentice who successfully sets right a grievous wrong (such as breaking up a child-slavery ring or seeing that a serial killer meets the same fate as his victims) is sure to earn her tutor’s esteem.</div><div>By the time a Daoine masters his second attainment, he has proven himself a skilled diviner of the great Scales of Wyrd and demonstrated his discretion in upholding the justice of Fate. Other Daoine no longer consider him a mere apprentice, though he still studies with his tutor. He is still expected to defer to Daoine of the third attainment, but he cannot simply be shouted down as a lower-ranked apprentice might. His tutor does not set him to menial labor or dictate his life; the apprentice is a colleague now.</div><div>As a Daoine progresses toward the third attainment, she may learn the most vicious curses the Daoine have devised over the centuries. The Good Folk know ancient hexes both subtle and insidious — and powerful enough to make the worlds tremble. Before imparting the third attainment, however, a tutor may set insidious tests to learn the student’s ability to temper her wrath to fit the severity of the transgression. Depending on the tutor, the apprentice fail the test if she overreacts, or she might anger her tutor and fail the test if she is too temperate. Most importantly, can she read the Scales of Wyrd subtly enough to anticipate what her tutor wants?</div><div>Once the apprentice has mastered the third attainment of the Daoine, he or she is truly a lord or lady among the Legacy’s ranks. If the apprentice and her tutor remain on cordial terms, the apprentice may remain nearby to assist her former teacher in the instruction of new apprentices or merely to work closely with one whose wisdom she acknowledges, but most Daoine strike out on their own. Some content themselves with continuing their work minding the Scales of Wyrd, while others continue their quest for knowledge and seek the elusive, semi-mythical fourth attainment. Of the success or failure of the latter Daoine, no reliable records exist, but that does not stop some Daoine from continuing to pursue the fourth attainment. If any of the Good Folk have reached this legendary degree of mastery, they must be among the most powerful masters of Fate in the world.</div>",

The Good Folk like their vengeance both subtle and terrible.

To the mage’s sight, the world becomes a bright, shining web of interconnections and tangled threads, taut as piano wires and constantly shifting as though weighed on great, invisible scales. The constant shift and swell of these connections can be somewhat disorienting at first, but the Daoine learn to focus selectively on the objects of their interest, filtering out distractions to focus on what they wish to know.</div><div>This attainment is the most basic ability of the Good Folk, and is instrumental to their work as the guardians of the Scales of Wyrd. Thus, the basic divinatory power of this attainment is used almost constantly, whenever a Daoine suspects that the Scales have been disturbed or are at risk. Surprisingly, despite the Daoine’s curse-happy reputation, most prefer to employ more subtle means of righting wrongs, especially if the transgressor is a Sleeper. When those methods fail, however, the Daoine do not hesitate to throw hexes.</div><div>This attainment allows the mage to use the Space 1 “Correspondence” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 232), allowing him to sense the sympathetic connections that make up the Scales of Wyrd at will. To activate this aspect of the attainment, the mage merely spends an instant action; no roll is required. The Daoine may also curse people using the Fate 2 “The Evil Eye” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 151), allowing him to inflict bad luck at will. Use the mage’s Fate dots as successes for the purpose of determining the effects of the attainment. The Daoine may not curse an individual more than once in any period between two moonrises with this attainment. The mage may, however, cast “The Evil Eye” as a spell without restriction, and he may curse a target with this attainment even if he has already cursed that individual with the spell since the last moonrise.</div>",

Sometimes, to properly carry the message that Something Bad Is Happening And You Should Change Your Ways, a Daoine must lay the curse of bad luck on a target’s possessions as well. This attainment is especially popular when the target of the Daoine’s wrath has an over-fondness for material objects.</div><div>The implementation of this attainment varies widely from Daoine to Daoine. Each seems to have his own preferred method of cursing, some based in the lore of faeries from their homeland, others apparently made up out of whole cloth. Popular methods include, but are not limited to, intoning dire portents of doom, spewing invective and vicious curses — and even mocking rhymes or satirical dances — their apparent absurdity underscoring the inherent power of the curse. Less theatrical Daoine might settle for walking three times widdershins around the object to be cursed, sprinkling it with saltwater or scratching a small mark on the object with the claw of a black cat.</div><div>As with the first attainment, Daoine rarely use their hexing powers on Sleepers. Despite the Daoine’s reputation, they are not stupid, and they realize that, in the modern world, few Sleepers associate a string of sudden misfortune with some form of karmic retribution, and even if they did, fewer still would realize why or what to do to correct the situation. Thus, this attainment is generally reserved for use on the Awakened, other supernatural creatures or very superstitious Sleepers who might deduce that their misfortunes are due to powerful curses.</div><div>This attainment allows the character to use the Fate 3 “Monkey’s Paw” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 155, allowing him to put a curse of ill luck on an object). Use the Daoine’s Fate dots to determine successes. Unlike the first attainment, the mage may curse the same target multiple times, but, after the first, a Willpower point must be spent in order to affect the same object each time, if the mage uses this attainment on the same target within the same period between moonrises.</div>",

If the Daoine is ignorant of the cause of the disruption, the victim only knows that something must be corrected, but not what.

Some Daoine prefer the traditional “deals signed in blood,” while other Daoine prefer to seal the deals with handshakes that conveniently conceal ancient, secret mudras.

The Good Folk do not hesitate to use the Doom of Promise when necessary, but a Daoine is generally considered a failure if he must resort to forcing the issue, rather than achieving his goals through slow, subtle curses or less heavy-handed sorceries.</div><div>This attainment allows the Daoine to use the Fate 4 “Sanctify Oaths” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 157, allowing him to bind a recalcitrant target to a sacred oath).

The mages of the Fallen Pillar believe that glorifying the physical form distracts the spirit. Unlike many of their brothers on the Path of Ecstasy, Fallen Pillar mages care little for their bodies. A mage of this Legacy knows she must free herself from the thousand appetites that flesh is heir to. She liberates herself from addictions and urges. She curbs her need for food and water. She learns that her body is temporary, and so she rakes it with long nails and cuts it with knives, showing the latticework of scars as evidence of enlightenment.</div><div>Mages of this Legacy attempt to live a truly ascetic lifestyle, denying all physical pleasures and mortifying the flesh. They mean to eradicate fear of life and death. With the body demeaned, with the flesh run ragged, they have no need to dread the vigors of life or the inevitability of death.</div><div>Fallen Pillars do not weep and sigh for the pleasures left behind. At first, its members may struggle grimly against the temptations of the physical world. Over time, however, they come to love their renunciations. Mages of the Fallen Pillar are taught to delight in denial. The soul laughs and leaps with joy as the body suffers.

        "orders": "The Exultants disturb many mages. The Exultants are too unpredictable, too willing to throw themselves and others into danger with little thought or preparation. To the mages of the Fallen Pillar, life is a mad dance, a whirling orgy of denial and martyrdom. The orders strive for greater stability. While none of the orders forbid Exultant members, the Adamantine Arrow is the only order that actively invites Fallen Pillar mages into its ranks. These ascetics can be vicious, if undisciplined, fighters. Upon the many battlefields of the secret world, the mages of the Fallen Pillar are frightening to behold: whirling storms of limbs and claws, shrieking and biting with casual disregard for their own lives. They gladly sacrifice their own bodies to save others.<div>Not all Exultants want to join an order, though. Younger Exultants are the likeliest: they probably joined an order before turning to the Fallen Pillar, and still feel attachments to cabals and other mages. Many older Exultants reject the very idea of orders and treat them as one more distraction from true purity and fearlessness. Exultants who do join orders often care little for the rules, though they may care a great deal for the order’s goals.</div>",
        "appearance": "A lifestyle of denial gives most Exultants a distinctive appearance. Most are incredibly thin, though they may couple their skinny bodies with ropy muscles. Many are sunburned. Few wear much clothing. Some Exultants let their hair and beards grow without ever cutting; others shave their heads, faces and bodies completely. Older, more powerful Fallen Pillars are frightening to behold. Their bodies are laced with scars and burns, and they are often so thin that they look nearly skeletal. Stranger still is the maniac, jubilant gleam in their eyes.",
        "background": "The Exultants accept Thyrsus mages of any background, but the majority of mages in this Legacy are those who “hit bottom.” Magic is a fickle and often overwhelming responsibility, and many mages cannot handle it. Some go mad. Others fall to addictions, ruin their relationships and destroy their families. Life as a mage is sink or swim, and many cannot stay afloat. For mages who sink, however, the Fallen Pillar stands ready to pull them out again. These ascetics seek those who are in the direst need of focus and control. The Exultants offer these wayward mages the chance to re-forge their souls in the kiln of bodily liberation.",
        "organizzation": "The Fallen Pillars have no formalized organization. They think ranks, offices and bylaws are just more anchors weighing down the soul.

They are not solemn monks hiding from the world. Denial only matters if you place yourself before the things you desire. A drug addict is only free of his dependence when he can gaze upon temptation and not give in to his craving.</div><div>Just as importantly, the Exultants see themselves as models for other mages — and Sleepers, too. The Exultants don’t preach their ways, however. Fallen Pillar mages believe their actions are example enough, showing how to achieve joy by rejecting the lures of the material world and the demands of the flesh. This means going out and walking among humanity and acting as part of heterogeneous cabals. Loneliness neither brings joy nor strengthens the soul, and so Exultants universally reject isolation except as a temporary exercise in self-mastery.</div>",

The Exultants care little for the past: you walk forward on the road, not backward. From time to time, however, it is worth looking back over your shoulder to see where you have been and how far you came. With that in mind, the mages of the Fallen Pillar tell some stories of the Legacy’s history. One might call these stories more parables than history, though.<h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Pillar Saint and Lucian the Bodiless</h3><div>This tale concerns the first mage of this Legacy, a nameless hermit whose world was shaken by a creature calling itself Lucian the Bodiless.</div><div>Once upon a time, this hermit — whom the Exultants call the Pillar Saint — lived a life of ascetic austerity. He did not eat, drink or sleep. His body was burned raw by the sun as he sat forever atop a tall pillar in the desert. He was very proud of himself and what he had accomplished. For 20 years he did not leave the top of the tall pole.</div><div>One day, when the sun was highest in the sky, a figure came to the hermit. This figure was not human, and its form was in fact nothing more than the outline of a body traced in a faint dusting of sand and tiny pebbles. This creature said its name was Lucian the Bodiless, and it asked the Pillar Saint what he was doing.</div><div>The Pillar Saint responded, “I am sitting atop this pillar. I have denied the Devil and all demons. I no longer submit to the physical world. I do not need food or water. Sleep is a distant dream.”</div><div>Lucian asked him why. “To make my spirit pure,” the Pillar Saint said. “I rely upon nothing in this world except my soul.” The bodiless figure laughed like a dust devil spinning on the ground. The Pillar Saint didn’t understand why he was being mocked, so he asked Lucian why he laughed.</div><div>“Because you are a happy fool,” Lucian said. With that, the figure clapped his nigh-invisible hands together, and a thunderclap split the hot desert air. The column beneath the Pillar Saint shattered into many pieces, and he toppled to the ground. Upon hitting the hard earth, his back broke, just as the pillar had, shattering in many places.</div><div>“You were relying upon the pillar,” Lucian said quietly, and then blew away on a warm wind. The Pillar Saint cackled, for now he was truly enlightened. He stood despite his cracked bones and wandered off, smiling. From then on, he called himself the Anchorite and decided that he would teach others how to destroy their pillars and fall jubilantly to the ground below.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>While the Exultants reject any formalized organization, they still pass along a number of teachings essential to the Legacy.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Three Liberations</h3><div>The crux of an Exultant’s teachings — in fact the very focus of his life — is denial of the non-essential. These distractions are not little things such as loud noises or a favorite television program. The Fallen Pillar sees most human desires as soul-stifling luxuries.</div><div>Exultants seek to liberate themselves from these fetters of desire. However, they do not expect a mage to throw off the shackles of the material world overnight. Fallen Pillars recognize that humankind has become addicted — not just to things like drugs or drink — but to a bevy of physical “necessities.” Emancipating oneself from these addictions is a long and certainly an arduous process. Mages of this Legacy traverse a series of steps they call the Three Liberations.</div><div>Some Exultants call this process “pruning the vine.” When a plant grows too lushly, it must be cut back to a single vine or stalk, or it may die from its own excess. An act that looks like mutilation actually heals. Human desires grow more rankly than any vine or weed, with grave consequences for the health of the soul. They, too, need curbing.</div><div>Once an Exultant rids herself of one set of distractions, she should begin working on the next. She is only truly allowed to move to the next Liberation after she proves herself to an Exultant of greater experience. The senior Exultant decides what test proves the student’s achievement. A tutor might ask his charge to live with him for a year to demonstrate her emancipation, or he might instead put her through a series of quick and rigorous challenges. Some Exultants use magic to read the minds and souls of their juniors, while other tutors ask for physical evidence.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Liberation From Want</h4><div>Most mages of this Legacy are at this stage. They seek to free themselves from the things they want. A mage’s wants can include nearly anything: drugs, alcohol, sex, video games, television, the Internet or co-dependent relationships. A mage at this stage seeks to unburden herself of such needless cravings.</div><div>Exultants at this level are not total ascetics. They neither harm their own bodies by cutting or branding the flesh nor do they submit to a regimen of starvation and thirst. They endeavor only to a spartan austerity. Their homes and sanctums are likely empty of decoration. They sleep on cots or pallets. Clothing and hairstyles serve only practicality, not fashion. They drink only water and eat small meals, usually bland. They reject gadgetry and sever any physical relationships. At this phase, the Exultants begin the process of hollowing out themselves and their lives.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Liberation From Need</h4><div>Three primary needs dominate human life: food, water and shelter. At this stage, a Fallen Pillar distances himself as much as possible from this trifecta of human requirements. First, he leaves his home. He may not dwell within a physical shelter for more than a few nights at a time, and, even then, he will only do so if conditions become so harsh that he would die otherwise. Most mages at this stage become nomads, sleeping on the ground or in alleys. Exultants reject comfort, and learn to feel at ease out in the open, in whatever environment they find themselves. It doesn’t matter if it’s the asphalt jungle or a real jungle — the Exultant makes every step his home.</div><div>Fallen Pillars also reject hunger. They do not renounce food — only the most powerful mages can truly live without eating. Rather, the mages deny their desires for food. They must grow comfortable with hunger, even revel in it. When their bellies growl in the hollows below bared ribs, the mages must rejoice in their disavowals of need. They should push themselves to the brink of death before finally eating. And, when they do eat, they do not do so out of desperation, wolfing down handfuls of food. When they finally decide to eat, they eat little: a handful of nuts, a few leaves plucked from an herb garden, a few berries in the palm of the hand. The mages eat the bare minimum of what their bodies require.</div><div>Fallen Pillars at this level can use magic to push themselves further. They don’t see this as a weakness. Magic is a tool to be used. Unlike material things, magic isn’t a distraction, and so it is perfectly acceptable if an Exultant uses her magic to keep her body running beyond the point of starvation (Life 2 “Body Control” is especially useful; see p. 182 of Mage: The Awakening.) The attainments of this Legacy are also helpful in this regard.</div><div>Third comes the mages’ refusal of thirst. As with hunger, the mages don’t reject water, just the desire for it. The suffering of thirst — dry mouth, weakened body, dizziness — must be overcome. When the mages drink, they drink only water, and only as much as they need to survive. Again, magic and attainments can be used to push themselves to new extremes.</div><div>Exultants are expected to take on other characteristics at this time. While they are not required to begin branding or scarring themselves yet, mages of this Legacy are expected to cover themselves with tattoos. Inking one’s flesh hurts. It draws blood. It separates the mage from everybody else and makes the body an artificial thing, an expression of the mind instead of a brute accident of nature. The design of the tattoos are up to each Exultant, but many choose patterns of thorny vines, magical symbols or faux injuries.</div><div>Mages of the Fallen Pillar also tend to wear very little clothing at this stage. Whatever they wear should be meager — it might mean stripping down to their undergarments or even wearing rags and sacks. Only in completely adverse conditions are these mages expected to wear anything more. Even then, it’s not unusual to see an Exultant stepping lightly through a snowstorm wearing nothing but a T-shirt and a pair of ragged jeans. At no point do they wear shoes.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Liberation From Fear</h4><div>Older Exultants become paragons of asceticism, though few mages ever reach this stage. By now, they’ve unchained themselves from all indulgences and necessities. They are likely tattooed, with their skin bitten by frost or reddened by the sun. They might be completely bald, having shorn every millimeter of hair from their entire bodies. Alternately, they might be so hairy that they look like wild men with unkempt manes (of both beard and hair) that could serve as nests for birds. How much further can they go?</div><div>This stage is all about separating oneself from fear. To reject fear, Fallen Pillars are not expected to avoid it, but to confront it directly. They must dance around their fears, laughing, making their fears smaller than themselves — so small, in fact, that the fears can be eaten like a berry or stepped on like a bug.</div><div>Some fears are base and simple (phobias of spiders, snakes, darkness), whereas others are infinitely more complex (fear of abandonment, betrayal, intolerance). Every fear must be challenged, defied and defeated. A phobia of spiders means the mage must not only cover herself in spiders, but she must stay close to them at all times, living with them, becoming them for a time if she has sufficient magical power. If the mage fears loneliness, then he must abandon himself. He must leave civilization for a time, and perhaps even leave his own body.</div><div>All mages — in fact, all people — are driven by two fears greater than all others. Everyone fears life and death.</div><div>All are afraid to live and feel without restraint, to experience the massive highs and lows of every emotion — joy and sorrow, anger and tranquility. Mages of the Fallen Pillar must embrace these emotions, for they are pure. But the mages must also learn not to lose themselves within the emotions, or let them become another drug. Anger comes, but should also be allowed to leave. Joy is the same.</div><div>The fear of death presents its own challenges. All suffering points to this fear, because death is the great unknown. Mages at this stage do not try to escape the fear of death by learning Death magic. An Exultant snubs death by showing it that she does not care about it one way or another. She lets death know that she will meet it head on with glowing eyes and a blood-smeared grin. To do this, she hurts herself. Each Exultant chooses his own forms of pain. He may bite or claw himself. Perhaps he cuts himself with razors or burns brands into his flesh. Some Exultants go to further extremes and castrate themselves or remove other parts. To truly see beyond death, some Exultants decide to be blind. To learn how to communicate the secrets of fear, they may cut out their tongues.</div><div>Such bodily mortification is done with jubilance. Exultants sing hymns to the trees as they bleed from their injuries; Exultants run laughing down the city streets with skin still sizzling from fiery wounds. Many Exultants also become mad martyrs at this stage. Caring little for their physical life means they can leap into battle with complete abandon. They might jump in front of swords to save friends, or even go into an enemy’s lair armed with mean magic and backpacks full of explosives.</div><div>The point of all this is to prove to themselves that the soul matters, not the physical form. The body is temporary; the soul is permanent. One’s flesh is little more than a suit of clothing. Over time, all fabrics fray.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Scouring</h3><div>Exultants are taught early on that it is not only acceptable to scour their Patterns for Mana, but it is encouraged. Mana is the energy of the spirit, forever food for the soul. The body, on the other hand, is weak and temporary. If one is in desperate need of food for the spirit, then it is fine for the body to suffer. Mages working on the Liberation from Fear regularly diminish their Attributes and Health to fuel their magical abilities: Pattern scouring becomes their first source of Mana for spells, rather than their last. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Duality</h3><div>The only relationship that matters inside the Legacy is the one between tutor and apprentice. The tutor (also called “liberator”) helps to shepherd the apprentice (also “slave”) through the Liberations. While the mages of this Legacy aren’t discouraged from association with other members, it is by no means required. However, no liberator should work with more than one slave. Every apprentice is different. What works for one does not work for all, and every pupil deserves a tutor’s undivided attention.</div><div>The bond between liberator and slave is meant to be permanent. Only death should sever the tie between them. The Fallen Pillar teaches that while the liberator frees the slave from the material world, the liberator himself is also liberated in the process. Many tutors and apprentices join cabals together. Even when they don’t, they still maintain a close connection, and often meet one another in dreams or the Shadow Realm.</div><div>One of the less-noted responsibilities of the liberator is punishment. The Liberations are difficult, and slaves may “fall off the wagon” from time to time. This is expected, but not allowed to go unpunished. Chastisement is often harsh, and generally tailored toward the nature of the slave’s transgression. If an apprentice fell back into an old drug addiction, then she and her tutor may go out together to destroy the dealer who sells the poison. If an apprentice cannot abide his starvation, he may be force-fed so much food that he becomes sick for days or even ruptures his stomach lining (which the liberator will heal — eventually). Many tutors keep punishment simple: pain. They cane their apprentices, cut them, brand them or do whatever it takes to cauterize the spiritual wounds.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Anchoritic Masters</h3><div>Legends of the Fallen Pillar say that members who achieve the final Liberation are visited by one of the Anchoritic Sages. These reclusive Exultants invite the mage to join their ranks. If a mage accepts the invitation, she goes away with the Anchorite and is never seen again. If she rebuffs the Anchorite, she is purportedly destroyed.</div><div>No one can prove the Anchoritic Sages exist or that they don’t. (Most teachers recognize the paradox in the stories: one way or another, no one who receives the Anchorites’ invitation could ever tell anyone else about it.) Legacy legend certainly offers a number of tales about Sages who act without announcing themselves, and other Exultants only later guess what they must have been. These tales suggest that the Anchorites are truly liberated beings. They do not eat or sleep. Their bodies are skin-draped skeletons, and yet they are vibrant with the vigors of life. Many Anchorites are supposedly missing body parts, and yet have “phantom” limbs that replace the amputated pieces. Other stories suggest the Sages are accomplished body-jumpers, hopping between animal and human bodies daily, never staying in one “shell” too long.</div><div>One ironic tale, however, tells how an Exultant encountered a mage who claimed he was an Anchoritic Sage. The Anchorite did not match any of the earlier descriptions, and was in fact a normal-looking man in a business suit. He had a briefcase in one hand, a cell phone in the other and stood at a hot dog stand ordering his lunch. When the Exultant asked why the self-styled Sage had abandoned his training, he simply declared that he had “liberated himself from the Liberations,” and was, as such, “utterly enlightened.” Then he laughed, and headed for the subway.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Acceptance of Bliss</h3><div>Mages of the Fallen Pillar are taught to take comfort and joy in their asceticism. The Legacy does not tell them to become morose monks or weeping flagellants. Jubilation, they’re told, results from strengthening the spirit. Each scar comes with laughter. Starvation and thirst deserve howls of triumph. The fact that they call their actions “Liberations” instead of “Denials” is very telling. The Exultants see such deprivations as chances for new possibilities, not closings off of potential. The Exultants take pleasure in their lack of pleasure.</div><div>Curiously, the Legacy does not shun loving relationships. The Exultants deny themselves physical love, but not emotional or spiritual love. Many Legacy members fall in love. Few Exultants frown upon such behavior, provided the relationship does not become physical. In their eyes, denying love a physical expression strengthens the emotional bond between lovers, by removing the selfish desire for pleasure. Sexual love is an anchor. Without it, two (or more) people can be free.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Interactions</h3><div>Mages of the Fallen Pillar inspire strong and opposite reactions from other mages. Exultants tend to be incredibly loyal, nearly to a fault, and commit themselves to every task with zealous delight. However, this self-abandoning passion so frightens some mages that they refuse to accept an Exultant as a cabal-mate or even acquaintance. Whispered stories tell of old, powerful Exultants who saw their cabals as “extensions” of their own bodies. As such, they had little problem casually throwing their cabal-mates into battles they couldn’t win, lashing them with Paradox or forcing their weak minds to share their asceticism. Are these tales true? Perhaps. While many mages of the Fallen Pillar are wise and focused individuals, any mage can fall to hubris and decide that nothing matters except her own will.</div><div>The Exultants encourage members to join cabals. Exultants believe the soul suffers when it lacks company. Fallen Pillar tenets don’t demand that members try to “convert” their cabal-mates to the Legacy’s ways. Exultants do not judge what others do or ask that their allies “liberate” themselves from material entanglements.</div><div>That doesn’t mean that only a cabal benefits from an Exultant’s presence. The Liberations aren’t easy: some mages free themselves with complete and total success every time, but most experience setbacks. In many ways, the cabal goes along for the ride and shares the successes and failures. The other mages witness the suffering and occasional madness of their Exultant cabal-mate. A time may come when the Exultant is too weak to perform whatever task the cabal needs done (though he’ll surely try). As an Exultant grows in age and power, he may become reckless with his own life. This Legacy produces many martyrs. Although Exultants can help their friends with a truly transcendent loyalty, mages who don’t care about their own safety and sanity may forget that their allies do not share the Exultants’ flippant disregard.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Other Principles</h3><div>The Exultants follow various other precepts with greater or lesser zeal. These principles are not universal like the Liberations. A tutor may forgo some or all of these precepts, according to her own taste or what she thinks would best serve her pupil’s enlightenment.</div><ul><li>Physical items are crutches an Exultant should throw away. Magical items are seen similarly. Most Exultants prefer to work without Artifacts, Enhanced items or Imbued items.</li><li>This disavowal of material objects doesn’t include magical tools. A mage may get along without magical tools most of the time — but failing an exercise of the soul’s power from refusal to use a tool is vanity, not liberation. Exultants prefer simple tools made from the body or from nature (blood, tree branches, strips of skin, animal pelts). The Legacy’s favorite tool is a knife. Many Exultants make their own knives with unadorned wooden handles and hand-sharpened shivs of metal.</li><li>Few Exultants own libraries or sanctums. If an Exultant does have a library, it is something that can travel with the mage. Some Exultants carry backpacks full of notepads. A few Exultants carve Arcane knowledge into their bare flesh or scribe grimoires on parchment made from their own flayed skin.</li><li>As a Legacy, the mages of the Fallen Pillar are not pacifists. Many learn martial arts or craft their own “styles” (which often include a lot of laughing, biting and leaping around). These mages rarely train with any weapons except knives, small wooden batons (such as escrima sticks) or similar improvised blunt weapons (broken chair legs, two-by-fours, broomsticks).</li><li>The Fallen Pillar Legacy accepts the use of some drugs that lack obvious addictive properties and offer some benefit to the spirit. For instance, some tutors allow the sparing use of hallucinogenic drugs, as a way to break old habits of thought. The Legacy only favors natural hallucinogens (peyote, mushrooms, ayahuasca, oo-koo-he). These drugs are sometimes used as sacraments for extended spellcasting.</li></ul><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>A tutor of the Fallen Pillar does not accept a pupil lightly. Exultants have no criteria for what kind of person can burn their souls in the forge of this Legacy, because such criteria are artificial. Saying “he must be this or she must be that” means nothing, because a mage always appears who violates those characteristics and still makes a fine Exultant. The Fallen Pillar cares about what a mage does, not who he is. Actions, after all, speak louder than words.</div><div>Of course, a mage must be Thyrsus to learn the attainments. The Exultants gladly train mages of any persuasion and interest, though, helping them escape the cruel bonds of insanity and addiction. One can still live by the Fallen Pillar’s joyful asceticism without actually belonging to the Legacy.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>A Hand in the Darkness</h3><div>Fallen Pillar mages do not always come to this Legacy on their own. No, many times tutors without apprentices (or slaves who are now ready to become liberators) will seek out new initiates. These Exultants look for Awakened who have fallen. Mages can be frail. Magic is wild and fickle, and some minds can’t always handle the overwhelming power of touching the Supernal. Many fall to drink or drugs. Some lodge themselves in co-dependent relationships or binge sexually. Others become addicted to the magic itself, Paradox and caution be damned. When one hits the very bottom of the pit and the darkness seems impenetrable, an Exultant may come along and offer a hand to pull the poor soul up out of his hole.</div><div>A prospective tutor only makes this offer once. If a mage doesn’t wish to join, fine. He can always choose to come of his own volition later. (The Fallen Pillar prefers this in some ways, for the applicant shows true interest and devotion.) </div><div>Other potential Exultants come seeking tutors all on their own. The mages of the Fallen Pillar are sights to behold: frail, scarred — and triumphant. They show a strange grandeur that pulls mages to them. Any who come or are invited are welcome to begin the arduous journey toward total liberation. First, however, they must show true dedication.</div><h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Offers on the Altar</h3><div>Every initiation is different, unique to the tutor. The theme of each initiation, however, is universal. A mage must show that she is capable of sacrifice. The liberator sets the nature of this sacrifice. It may be physical, emotional, social or spiritual. The liberator’s personality comes through when setting the sacrificial requirement. A tutor whose body is a roadmap of chaotic scars may ask that the sacrifice be physical, an offer of pain and blood. If the tutor was once a methamphetamine addict, he may ask for his apprentice to free himself from some kind of worldly pleasure — or, stranger still, ask that the apprentice first addict himself to a potent substance and then show that he can free himself from it. Tutors may also tailor initiations to the applicants’ personalities. Other potential sacrifices include the following:</div><ul><li>Cut off all the fingers and thumb on one hand. Live for a month without them, at which point the applicant or another mage may draw down the Supernal to heal them.</li><li>Live in solitary confinement for a week with only bread and water. The mage may leave confinement at any time before this by knocking on the door. Doing so voids her initiation.</li><li>Burn all her social bridges. She must sever any relationship she has, whether it’s with a boyfriend, her mother or her old cabal-mates.</li><li>Scour himself for Mana, then use that Mana to fuel a spell that helps someone else.</li><li>If she is addicted to something (drugs, sex, food, magic), she must demonstrably separate herself from that thing. This might mean killing her dealer or destroying his stash. This might mean using magic to damage her sexual organs or pleasure centers. This might mean destroying her magical tools. A mage raised in the so-called comforts of urban civilization might be left in the woods or the desert for a week. Alternately, a nature-loving survivalist might be thrown into the urban sprawl for the same period of time.</li></ul>The slave complies and completes the sacrifice, or the slave is free to go. Mages can attempt their initiation three times. Thrice-failed means the doorway to liberation closes forever, from that Exultant at least. A candidate need not make his attempts one right after the other; in fact, he can take years between applications. Once the induction is complete, a mage may begin on the journey toward liberation.",

His back bows, his ribs show, his skin takes on a jaundiced pallor. Foes lured into this trap find that the mage is not nearly as weak as he appears.</div><div>This is a combination of two Life 3 effects, “Degrading the Form” and “Honing the Form” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 186). The mage may, as an instant action requiring no roll, subtract a number of dots from one Physical Attribute to appear weak. In the same action, he redistributes those dots to a different Physical Attribute. An Exultant who uses this attainment may take points away from Stamina, thus assuming an appearance of frailty or sickness. At the same time, he can bolster his Dexterity or Strength, so he can make stronger or quicker attacks. The end result is that the mage appears feeble (and with regard to one of his Physical Attributes, he is feeble), but is then able to redirect that energy into surprising an enemy with unexpected reserves of combat vigor. A character can only redistribute a number of dots equal to his Life Arcanum. Modifying Physical Attributes has a direct effect on their paired advantages (changing Stamina changes Health, changing Dexterity will change Initiative and possibly Defense and both Dexterity and Strength affect Speed).</div><div>This attainment is an expression of an Exultant’s potential martyrdom.

The mage gains these dice against any appropriate instinctual responses. For instance, she may gain the dice against Intimidation rolls made against her, if the other character tries threatening physical harm: The Exultant no longer pays attention to the body’s alarms.</div><div>Fear is a cloud, and this attainment dispels fear along with any forced reactions. Exultants at this level appear eerily calm in the face of grave danger, often acting joyful instead of anxious. The mage gains the bonus dice in the following situations: Resisting Intimidation attempts or Coercion, Resisting Poison or Disease and Resisting Seduction. (Sexual seduction requires a physical response.) The bonus is also given to any resistance rolls requiring Stamina.</div><div>The mage feels truly numb to her bodily instincts. She may also ignore all Wound penalties due to this disconnect. (The Storyteller may still demand occasional penalties, however.

These mages claim the Sleepers clog the mages’ concentration: that cities are cesspools, and only natural sources of magic are pure.</div><div>The House of Ariadne says that such thinking should have died with Atlantis, or at least with the invention of indoor plumbing. The cities are the true fount of power. Why are many people be drawn to the city? Money gathers in cities, yes, and political power, too — but could some subtler, greater lure attract people as well? Some mystical power in the sheer numbers of people? Atlantis is proof that even mages create more power when they gather together than the sum of their powers as individuals. </div><div>The mages of Ariadne’s House love everything about the city: the late nights, the crush of people, even the crime, the trash, the gang warfare and the homeless. Every aspect of the city, the good and the bad, creates the chaos in which Acanthus mages thrive. In a great city, you can see a $300 a ticket theater show one night and lose your fortune on the stock market the next morning. Fate’s long fingers manipulate lives within the city, and the city calls for its inhabitants to create buildings and spaces that endure longer than a human life. </div><div>The sheer variety you can find in the city, from debutante clubs to bondage clubs, draws the Metropolitans. One seldom sees $300 bottles of scotch drunk at a gentleman’s club in the suburbs. A rural town doesn’t create societies of homeless living underneath overpasses. Cities buzz with all kinds of people and lifestyles, and the noisier the buzz, the bigger the draw. </div><div>As a Metropolitan becomes more in tune with the energy of a city, she can follow a ley line wherever she likes. In time, she can learn to see a web of subtler lines, what the Legacy calls Ariadne’s thread, spun throughout the city. The thread can follow a ley line or lead a mage on a meditative path through the city. All the threads together form the city’s Knot. </div><div>These threads allow the city to communicate with the Metropolitans. Ariadne’s thread can help a mage locate physical things, such as lost items or people, or abstract things, such as a safe hiding place away from prying magical eyes, Hallows or areas that have borne witness to great happiness, fear or other strong emotions. The threads can even lead to symbolic locations that express the city’s own thoughts or messages to the mage. </div><div>Once the Metropolitan can follow Ariadne’s thread, the mage can learn what the city has to say about its history, its people and its magic. The city does not forget its history, the births and deaths, the crimes and benedictions. All the city’s secrets open to the view of a skilled and perceptive Metropolitan. The city becomes a tangled Knot only the Metropolitan can follow, walking the thread without getting lost.</div><div>The only trick is finding that thread.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Metropolitans",
        "orders": "The House of Ariadne does not favor any particular order. The Legacy doesn’t discourage members from belonging to any orders, but most Metropolitans are too busy following the threads of Fate to worry much about the Pentagram and its politics. Many Metropolitans never join an order, or they abandon former allegiances once they join the House. Those who do belong to an order are seldom very dedicated members.<div>The Metropolitans do, of course, step on the orders’ toes now and then. The Metropolitans claim the right to know everything that happens in the largest population centers in the world, and to interfere when they believe the city wants them to. Other mages sometimes disagree.</div><div>The Adamantine Arrow respects the House to a limited degree. The House of Ariadne was founded on strife, but few brave warriors appear in Legacy’s history. The Metropolitans prefer stealth and subtlety to combat. Nevertheless, when mages of the Arrow stalk a foe through the city, they like to have a Metropolitan assist them. Sometimes, they get one; sometimes, the House tells them to take their fight elsewhere.</div><div>The Free Council actively supports the House of Ariadne. The idea that Sleepers create magic through cities fits right in with the Free Council’s theory of magic never entirely leaving humanity. The Metropolitans agree that the Sleepers can sense the resonance of strong magic, and they are part of the city’s Supernal essence, but the Legacy does not believe that Sleepers can ever touch the magic they sense and help to create.</div><div>The Guardians of the Veil wish the House of Ariadne would join them and obey them. Both groups pull strings from covert positions to orchestrate what they like, their tools stealth and subterfuge. However, most of the mages in the House of Ariadne do not belong to the Guardians of the Veil, and, therefore, this Legacy operates outside the control of the order. Sometimes the Guardians and the House work together to solve a mystery; more often, the House probes matters the Guardians wish to remain hidden. In many cities, the Guardians strive to curb or subvert the House of Ariadne, while the House strives to dissuade the Guardians from such interference. The conflict occasionally erupts in exploding streets and burning buildings.</div><div>The Metropolitans’ knack for following threads of power and history makes them popular with the Mysterium. The House of Ariadne has powers to find things — or people — that have been lost, sometimes for millennia. When Mysterium investigators pursue urban mysteries, they aren’t shy about asking Metropolitans for help — and usually receive it. The two groups rarely disagree; conflict arises only when the Mysterium wishes to keep something hidden, and the House of Ariadne wants it revealed. If the Mysterium hides something within a city, especially something magical, the House of Ariadne is likely to find it. The Legacy does not make a habit of thieving, however. The House’s only precious possession is the city itself.</div><div>The Silver Ladder watches the House of Ariadne closely. Similar to the Guardians of the Veil, the Silver Ladder can see the Metropolitans as useful allies, or rogues who step out of line, pushing their cities on paths the Silver Ladder does not approve. They watch the House of Ariadne closely and interfere when they see need.</div><div>As the Seers of the Throne do with all mages save themselves, the Seers try to halt the Metropolitans’ work. The Seers have no place in their world for crazy people who talk to cities — especially when the cities talk back.</div>",
        "appearance": "A roomful of Metropolitans shows a broad cross-section of urban styles. Some members dress as (and are) wealthy socialites, viewing the city from a 30th story balcony. Other mages prefer to get closer to the underbelly and appear as rag-tag, cart-pushing homeless people. Still other Metropolitans are completely street, flaunting heavy, artistic tattoos, gaudy jewelry and gang colors. You don’t see Metropolitans wearing overalls, pastel blouses or T-shirts with slogans matching their spouses’. No one looking at the Metropolitans would assume anything but that they live in the city: not the suburbs, not the country, not the small towns or remote villages. The city, where people gather and live for reasons they don’t understand — but the Metropolitans do.",
        "background": "Few people who are not born city-dwellers choose this Legacy. A few suburbanites or country mages may find themselves drawn to the city and join the Legacy to understand the thread that dragged them there. Most Metropolitans, however, were born and raised in the city.<div>They grew up knowing the shortcuts, the best places to eat, the places not to go after dark. Often, they feel the city’s pulse before they Awaken.</div><div>Sometimes they have a knack for finding lost things or knowing who’s doing what in the neighborhood. Sometimes they walk the streets at night, heading nowhere in particular, just following paths they can’t quite see.</div><div>The Metropolitans call this half-sensed path Ariadne’s thread, and say their new members follow it to their destiny. After joining the Legacy, mages learn how to see Ariadne’s thread stretching over the streets, through alleys, up elevator shafts and through old, forgotten shops. This thin, golden line appears when the mage wishes to find something, or merely wishes to meditate, walking throughout the city.</div>",
        "organizzation": "Each city has one House; there are not multiple organizations in cities, even the larger ones. (Though the Legacy does not always follow the lines on a map in defining a city’s limits.) Each House of Ariadne, in turn, is divided into two levels: the Trackers and the Weavers.<div>Most Metropolitans are Trackers. Even if mages have been Awakened for years, they still need time to learn how to see and follow Ariadne’s thread. They practice by finding lost things and mapping the city’s secrets. Even if the city is only 100 years old, and has held a House of Ariadne for most of those years, the city always has more secrets to tell — from a secret love affair when the city was a village of 25 families to a hot dog vendor who is slowly poisoning his regular patrons. As Trackers gain skill, they are assigned to find particular lost items or people.</div><div>Some Metropolitans have an easier time than others communing with the city. These mages rarely sleep, preferring to walk the streets and talk to the city. Sleepers often think these mages are crazy homeless people, since they do nothing but walk, murmuring to themselves. These mages want to learn all of the city’s secrets and become honored lorekeepers among the House of Ariadne.</div><div>The Weavers are the most senior Metropolitans. They have at least their second attainment. Weavers supervise the other Metropolitans and manage the cities. Weavers plan the city’s future based on its past, deciding whether the city will grow, decay or stay the same. No matter how much they love their city, they do understand when a city tells them it needs to change.</div><div>In the past, cities could die outright from war, plague, dynastic shifts or natural disasters. Nowadays, cities morph and change but seldom die outright. Sometimes they devour other towns or cities, or are devoured themselves. More subtly, cities can grow smaller towns within themselves, communities with their own customs and privileges. College campuses are often their own cities in the eyes of the House, as are the worst of the slums or the shantytowns beyond the railroad tracks.</div><div>Although Weavers can meddle with the city’s fate, some Weavers simply sit back and wait for the city’s future to play out, watching and chronicling. The Weavers also dedicate themselves to walking the Knot in the city, looking for Ariadne’s Exit, as they call it, hoping to follow her thread to the Supernal Realm.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>When Theseus entered the labyrinth of King Minos to kill the Minotaur, the king’s daughter Ariadne fell for the handsome hero. She went to the inventor and architect Daedalus, who gave her a ball of string that would unwind and show Theseus his way back out of the labyrinth. Ariadne professed her love to Theseus and made him promise to take her home and marry her if she helped him kill the Minotaur and escape.</div><div>Theseus abandoned Ariadne on the island of Naxos. He betrayed her because she betrayed her people. Here, the myth says the god Dionysus fell in love with Ariadne, married her and made her immortal. Mages know better: They know Ariadne Awakened instead. With the help of priests on the island — and, later, with the help of her own magic — she built a massive fortress on top of a Hallow. Underneath, she built a Demesne, her own multi-leveled labyrinth she called the Knot. She kept the ball of thread that saved Theseus and walked the Knot daily with the thread’s help, and, later, without it.</div><div>People, island citizens and sailors alike, were drawn to her fortress, and she welcomed them all. Soon the fortress became its own city, and Ariadne’s power grew. Her followers included a few Awakened, looking for guidance. The somber mage taught them how to follow the thread of power that runs through large gatherings of people. She taught them how she had built her fortress-town along intersecting ley lines, but how countless other threads ran through it. A city, she claimed, remembered what happened within it, the good and the bad, and used the threads to point to areas of interest. These cities would last the ages, strengthened by the magic woven into them and the people who flocked there and remembering everything that happened within its borders. If you can connect with the city, you can learn its history and read its soul.</div><div>The House’s legends tell how Ariadne’s disciples pursued Theseus, secretly forcing him from his Athenian throne and into exile — removing him from his precious city just as he had lured their mistress away from hers. They harried him until he died. Ariadne threw a massive celebration when she heard the news. Sleepers and Awakened reveled for three days straight. Ariadne, after planning the party, retreated to her Demesne when the festivities began and spent the entire three days moodily walking the Knot.</div><div>Ariadne never took another lover, despite what Sleeper myths say. She had no desire to love again, and buried herself in her magical study and the expansion of her fortress and town.</div><div>Her somber mood rubbed off on her students; even today, Metropolitans are considered unusually dour for Acanthus.</div><div>Several years later, Ariadne disappeared while walking the Knot. Her most fervent students claim she finally followed her thread to the Supernal Realm. Cynics say she got lost, died and no one could find her body.</div><div>As the years passed, Ariadne’s students emigrated to the cities of the world. Some students actually built the cities, laying their first streets according to Ariadne’s mystic geometry. They confirmed that the cities that lasted hundreds of years, defying war, plague and other catastrophes, followed natural ley lines as well as Ariadne’s thread, whether the House of Ariadne had influenced their building or not.</div><div>All the mages looked for students in their cities, focusing on people who endlessly prowled the city as if following something or just watched the city from balconies and rooftops. These Sleepers, and later Awakened, seemed lost, but the House of Ariadne thought they knew the way better than most. They merely look for a path that most people — including other Awakened — cannot see.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Some Awakened view the House of Ariadne as madmen who cannot communicate with anyone or anything but their city. This is an extreme case. A few Metropolitans do nothing but wander the Knot of their city, but most Legacy members are functioning mages, serving their order and cabal as well as the House.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Secrets of the City</h3><div>Metropolitans spend most of their time investigating their own cities. Metropolitans track the city’s history, learning everything from the location and use of the first building to the latest crappy apartment where a wannabe actor killed himself. Mystical information — ley lines, Hallows, Verges, places where magic was done and the haunts of ghosts and other supernatural creatures — hold a special interest for the House as mystical information does for most mages, but House members do not scorn even the most obscure or mundane details of urban life and history.</div><div>Houses vary in how they store this information. Butterfly Smith, a Weaver in Los Angeles, writes that city’s history on spiral-bound notebooks that she carries in her shopping cart. Her magic protects her library from the elements, and her immediate proximity to it keeps it from prying eyes and stealing hands. At the other extreme, the Weavers of London built a grand library within the Underground. Eidechse, a tech-savvy Weaver in Hamburg, stores his House’s histories on a server that is backed up daily. His most novice Metropolitan receives the job of securing the back-ups in a safe place. Hamburg’s other Weavers express concern at giving such an important, if menial, job to a novice. But Eidechse claims that offering such trust teaches responsibility and dedication to the House. As of yet, Hamburg’s House has suffered no security breach.</div><div>Other mages often go to the House of Ariadne for information. Sometimes these mages find what they seek, sometimes not. Though some Metropolitans keep immaculate records, others simply feel the act of writing down the city’s lore is enough, and don’t care whether they have a system to find the information later. Butterfly Smith knows who killed Nicole Brown Simpson, but she would be hardpressed to tell you which notebook holds the information. At other times, the city remembers such outrageous things that inquiring mages simply do not believe what the Metropolitans tell them. Many mages doubt the power of the Metropolitans, or refuse to believe that the city remembers its past and can speak with the Awakened.</div><div>The Metropolitans do not mind the disbelief too much. They know that cities do not lie, and mages are very likely to, so Metropolitans find it amusing when mages show such hypocrisy.</div><div>Metropolitans spend a lot of their time finding lost items or people. They do most of their searching for their House and the city itself. Members find artifacts (and sometimes Artifacts) and items for the Weavers to use in tending the city, or collect memorabilia of events a member thinks the city wants the House to know about.</div><div>A House may also serve as bloodhounds for other mages. The morals of each House change from city to city. In one city, the House helps the Consilium find mages who break the Lex Magica; in another, the Metropolitans serve as treasure-hunters-for-hire. A House may offer its services for the good of Awakened. More often, Metropolitans require payment. Other mages sometimes see the House as mercenary, but the Weavers simply ask such mages how often they serve other mages free.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Keepers of the City</h3><div>The Metropolitans do not merely spend their days communing with the city, treasure-hunting and collecting obscure historical trivia. They want to see where the city is currently going and, more importantly, where it needs to go. As Acanthus mages, they study the paths of Fate in a city as a natural progression. Metropolitans were there for the fall of Rome and the reunification of Berlin. They use their magic (beyond their attainments, of course) to push the city in the direction they wish it to go — or where the city itself wants to go. The Metropolitans have a hard time explaining the difference to other mages, or seeing it themselves.</div><div>Since they, alone, can commune with the city, Metropolitans see themselves as the keepers of the cities, and it is their job to know when to prune, when to encourage growth and when to purge. They love the cities, but love them as a gardener loves a rosebush that grows too far into the path; sometimes, even a beautiful thing must be cut back for its own good. Metropolitans have influenced mobs, fires, even wars. They have eyes inside the government and the offices of CEOs, anyone — Sleeper or Awakened — who has a hand in the city’s future. The House of Ariadne is there to guide a potential destiny, or cut it off entirely.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Mystical Conflicts</h3><div>Predictably, the House’s attitude upsets other mages who do not see their homes going up in flames as a good and natural thing. In these cases, the orders may interfere with the House of Ariadne. Some mages send spies to discover what the Metropolitans plan for their cities, and work directly against them. The House of Ariadne is used to this, of course. In addition to manipulating the city, Metropolitans also plot to head off the efforts of other mages. There are Metropolitans whose sole jobs are to watch what the other local mages do to change the city, and derail their plans if necessary.</div><div>Often these movements have to be as covert as possible, since the various orders won’t abandon their plans just because the House of Ariadne wants the orders to. Several cities have stalled in their evolution simply because the House of Ariadne and an order (most often the Silver Ladder or the Seers) have locked horns, and no one seems able to win a clear victory. In the short term, other mages usually win conflicts against the House of Ariadne; Metropolitans just aren’t fighters. In the long term, the struggles become more even. The House always seems to know more about its enemy’s doings than vice versa, and Metropolitans are better at hiding and accumulating tiny, long-term advantages.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Rituals</h3><div>The House of Ariadne holds three yearly celebrations to honor the Legacy and the city.</div><div>The first ceremony takes place on the city’s birthday, which is not always the day of its establishment in the Sleepers’ bureaucratic records. The city knows when it was no longer a grouping of farmhouses or nomad tents and when it became a city. The Metropolitans ask the city where they should hold their celebration, and follow Ariadne’s thread to that place. If it is a convention hall, they simply rent it; for an outside venue, they plan an outdoor party. In 1994, Dublin apparently instructed its Metropolitans to celebrate in the home of a descendant of a woman the city considered a hero 400 years before; persuading the woman to host a party for a bunch of strangers took a fair bit of blarney as well as magic. The celebration typically lasts an afternoon, and is open to the public, Sleepers and Awakened alike. The Metropolitans put a spin on the celebration, of course. In Boston, the city desires that Sleepers walk the thread of Ariadne once a year, so the House of Ariadne started the Boston Marathon, to weave the Sleepers through their city.</div><div>The second festival honors the House. This can happen on any date; some of the older Houses remember the day of Theseus’ death and follow Ariadne’s example of throwing a three-day bacchanalia in honor of the event. The newer cities, including most of the ones in North America, honor the date of the local House’s inception. They, too, throw a three-day party, abandoning their duties to any other mages who may have hired them. No outsiders are invited to this celebration. The House prefers to gather at a Demesne constructed by senior members, allowing the mages to drop all caution and catering to the Lie. The head Weaver of the city’s House spends the three days walking the Knot of the city in honor of Ariadne.</div><div>The third holiday is a somber ritual. The mages spend a week discerning where the city locates its heart; this changes as the city evolves. All of the Metropolitans then gather at the heart and meditate on the city’s future, their dedication to the city and how they can better serve it. This does not differ terribly from the everyday meditations the mages may do, except they all do it at once, increasing the resonance and the connection with the city. Since this ritual likely takes place in front of Sleepers, the Metropolitans don disguises to look like a yoga group, exhausted tourists or even a political sit-in so that they do not attract too much unwanted attention. After the meditation is over — and this one has no time limit, the mages know from the city when it is time to sever the connection — they lock themselves away and discuss the plans for the coming year.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Although the House of Ariadne offers to train nearly anyone who asks, Metropolitans turn away mages who cannot see Ariadne’s thread after a training period. Those who can see it without Metropolitan training are welcomed immediately. Of course, only an Acanthus mage can actually join the Legacy.</div><div>A Metropolitan needs patience, above all else. It takes time to wander the Knots and divine the secrets the city tells. Once a recruit proves she can see Ariadne’s thread, she is taken to a spot in the city and told to follow the path. The mentor follows, not commenting, seeing if the protégé can follow the path. The candidate is not told to find anything in particular, just to walk and meditate. If she hesitates or asks questions within one hour, she is told to walk the streets for a month, looking for Ariadne’s thread, before she returns for more training. A mage accompanies her, concealed, to make sure she trains. A mage who follows the thread for two hours without speaking is accepted with the warning that much patience is needed. If a candidate walks for three hours, intent on the thread, she is welcomed into the House of Ariadne.</div><div>If an applicant cannot find the thread, the watchful Metropolitans remove themselves from the test and let the mage wander until he gives up. If he does not give up, and eventually tracks down his departed mentor, the House gives the applicant one more chance; any mage can have a bad day.</div><div>After induction, a tutor trains the pupil in the art of tracking, including people, items and abstractions. Periodically, House mentors test the mage’s power to sense the city, question him on things that happened in a particular spot last night, a year ago, 10 years ago and so on. These tests are always subtle, a casual request made by a mentor in sequence with other commands. Get enough answers right, and the character receives invitations to more private meetings of senior House members. Mages who get too many answers wrong end up as Trackers for the rest of their lives, or the House gradually shuts them out and stops teaching.</div><div>The trial to become an elite Weaver tests a mage’s personal strength. He is commanded to walk Ariadne’s thread, meditating on his own death. If he can follow the path to face the symbol of his own death, the other Weavers welcome him to their ranks.</div><div>The meditation to discern one’s own death takes three days of uninterrupted contemplation. The Weavers do not tell their students this; the Weavers use the time as a way to weed out any liars who claim to have seen their death within a couple of hours. At this point, the Weavers sever the candidates’ ties with the Legacy and refuse to train, or speak to, the mages again. Their only chances are to move to new cities, and hope the House of Ariadne there does not speak to those Weavers who threw them out of their previous cities.</div><div>The House of Ariadne bases its entire Legacy on the premise that cities do not lie. Thus, Metropolitans must convey the city’s truth in whole, not changing any of it. On occasion, the Weavers check the reports of novice members to see if they are lying or embellishing the truth. Any mage found lying is sent from his tutor without trial or explanation. Upon induction, the Weavers tell a new Metropolitan these rules, how truth protects the foundation of their Legacy and how one lie can weaken it.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Disciplinary Issues</h3><div>Despite what some Metropolitans would like to believe, they are neither infallible nor incorruptible. Legacy members have fabricated information or committed other offenses against their Houses. In cases in which punishment seems warranted, the Weavers use Time magic to find the likely consequences of different penalties. If the Weavers think a mage deserves a chance to reform, they choose the penalty most likely to teach the desired lesson, and least likely to breed bitter resentment.</div><div>Now and then, a House finds it must confine an erring member or an enemy. The Weavers ask the city itself where they could hold a magical criminal. Many cities have led a Metropolitan mage to a perfect space in which to create a small prison suitable for mages. The House of Ariadne does not usually want to serve as jailers for all Awakened: Metropolitans see the Silver Ladder filling that role, like it or not. The House takes care of its own, though, and deals with its own as well.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Guides to the Urban Labyrinth</h3><div>Not all geomancers — mages who follow the ley lines and Hallows —belong to the House of Ariadne. However, any mage who studies geomancy and the teachings of Ariadne can learn to talk to the cities to discover their secrets. Many mages who do not join the House of Ariadne at least honor Ariadne’s research and discoveries. Older mages who join the Metropolitans are often geomancers who find their studies can go no further without the Legacy’s guidance. As long as cities exist, Metropolitans will be there to talk to the cities and teach other mages how to see Ariadne’s thread.</div><div>The ability to see and follow Ariadne’s thread is not a distinct spell; rather, it’s a divinatory technique for a variety of Fate, Space and Time effects, either as a single Arcanum or in conjunction. For instance, a mage who seeks the current mayor’s favorite childhood toy could define the resonant connection between person and toy using “Interconnections” (Fate 1), then start at the mayor’s home and seek the toy’s location using Space 2, walking until she finds the toy or gives up. Following the golden thread is an extended action, so a mage can accumulate successes to follow very weak sympathetic connections.</div><div>Much of the time, though, Metropolitans just cast blindly and trust Ariadne’s thread to lead them somewhere interesting — relying on Fate 2 “Extraordinary Luck” to reveal something useful for the Legacy to know.</div>",
        "magic": "",
        "attainmentsDescrizione": "The House’s geomancy requires mastery of divination, but instead of focusing on a small item like a crystal or a pack of cards, Metropolitans use the expanse of the city to divine the past, present and future. The mage who wishes to follow Ariadne’s thread must study Time and Fate. Much of the Metropolitans’ powers come from walking a self-made Knot in the city. The House of Ariadne never takes the direct route.",

        "firstAttainmentDescription": "<div>After seeing Ariadne’s thread, the first step a mage must take is attuning himself to the city. He must initially spend six hours walking through the city, following Ariadne’s thread. After this, he may use this attunement to feel the city’s history. This resembles the Time 2 spell “Postcognition.” While the mage might not know names, he can tell if and when a man was murdered on this street corner, or if a couple made love in a park or if a mage committed a vulgar spell in a movie theater. A mage is not married to the city in which he Awakened. He can attune himself to any city he is in.</div><div>The symbolism of the city makes itself known to the mage, as the city’s resonance applies different meanings to different things. (For example, a park’s “Tunnel of Love” may resonate happiness or sexual energy for most cities, but if a brutal murder happened there, the ride may resonate with fear, hatred and death.) This knowledge will come in handy in later attainments.</div>",

As long as the target is in the city, the mage doesn’t need to have a sympathetic connection to the target. Ariadne’s thread will lead him to where it is, but the path will not be direct. The whole process is actually a specialized, somewhat oblique use of “Divination” — but instead of seeking a clue about what another person will do in the future, the mage asks what path is most likely to lead him to his goal.</div><div>Following the thread of Fate may take some time, and if the mage seeks a kidnapped colleague, the mage has no guarantee the person won’t be dead when the mage finds her. The meditation will not work if the item or person leaves the material plane; the trail simply goes cold. If the target is kept behind considerable defenses, whether locked doors, vaults or magical protection, Ariadne’s thread will not give the mage any abilities to bypass the security. The thread only leads the way to the object desired, but does not tell you the best, or safest, way to get there. </div>",

She will find an answer, if such an answer exists at all: as with the Time 4 spell “Prophecy,” the mage obtains advice on the consequences of a planned course of action or a course of action to bring about any desired result. At the Storyteller’s discretion, the mage may walk for one hour or one day, but she must keep walking until she gets her answer. Ariadne’s thread will eventually lead the mage to a series of symbols that give her answer. Although the answer may not be apparent to any companion to the mage, she will understand its meaning and what the geomantic meditation is telling her. If the city does not know the answer to the question, or the question is too vague, the thread may lead the mage in circles or nowhere at all.",

        "descrizione": "<div>Pygmalion sculpts an image, the perfect Platonic form of woman. He prays. Through his act of will, the unliving image becomes the perfect living form. It’s a romantic  conceit. The Pygmalian Society takes this conceit as a manifesto for the transformation of the human race, an allegory for their great work: every Pygmalian strives to be at once artist, artwork and animating force.</div><div>Art is at the middle of everything. Although the Pygmalian Society’s members’ styles vary, they agree that art, true art, Real Art with a capital “A,” becomes a link to the Supernal World that inspires and alters the human soul. Real Art creates an Awakening — a small, temporary Awakening, sure — but it’s an Awakening. Art is magic. And Magic is Art.</div><div>The Pygmalians believe that Art is one of the last things that still link the Sleepers to the Supernal realm.True Art — great Art — molds and shapes human history. Great Art inspires people. Great Art incites anger. Great Art provokes action.</div><div>Every Pygmalian is an artist. The Pygmalians’ magical attainments reflect this. They style themselves as the “Sculptors” of magical reality. They try to imbue every action, every spell they cast, with meaning.</div><div>As Pygmalians progress, they become their own greatest Artworks. Pygmalians adopt roles. They take on parts, deliberately altering their memories, senses and the way they see things in a search for inspiration — for themselves and others. The Sculptors remake themselves in their own image. They act in their own plays, become the protagonists of their own stories.</div><div>Through the creation of Art and themselves as Artworks, the Pygmalians seek to effect change. An inspired human soul leads to action, and history takes a new course. These mages recognized from the very beginning that the power of Disbelief stops their magic from altering the world in any but the smallest way, so the Pygmalians work to inspire and change the minds and souls of Sleepers with the power to do the same. Through the Pygmalians’ art, they inspire artists, who in turn have the potential to create something great. The Pygmalians are muses. They’re propagandists. They’re agents provocateur.</div><div>The true Sculptor is obsessed with the future, but lives in the here and now. A Pygmalian develops the ability to sense the interplay of time and fate in the lives of the people around him, experiencing an intense kind of synesthesia. He can smell pain, hear joy, taste anger. The most talented Pygmalians can see human destinies laid out before them in tastes and colors. These Pygmalians sense the weft and weave of destiny and possibility. Then they embroider with new potentials for inspiration. They want to create a path that the Awakened can travel more easily, at the end of which lies the Awakening of every man, woman and child on the planet.</div><div>The actual medium of the Pygmalians’ Art is open — any art, high or low, can change things. The Sculptors are obsessed with finding a Holy Grail of true inspiration that will bring about history-changing art. Charles Dickens wrote a few works of fiction and ignited Western society’s conscience toward the urban poor. Renaissance painters invented perspective drawing, and a mathematics of space that redefined the world. The writers and translators of the Bible changed the course of  human history many times over.</div><div>Art can be deadly, too. Leni Riefenstahl propagated the sinister glamour that made a nation complicit in the deaths of millions. China’s official TV and newspapers have convinced the most populous nation in the world that the Tiananman Square massacre never happened, that stories of the massacre are just an American plot. Advertising agencies use art to relieve people of their money and leave them in perpetual discontent.</div><div>Change happens around the Pygmalians. They are not always the direct cause, but they’re always there, nudging things along. People fall in love. Scientists find new insights into the nature of things. Revolutions begin, or end in blood and fire.</div><div>Whatever the Pygmalians do, they accept no barriers to their Art. With no boundaries, it’s inevitable that some Sculptors go bad. These fallen Pygmalians don’t confine their Art within moral limits. A Pygmalian might commit atrocities to effect the inspiration of a single individual. A Pygmalian’s deeds can easily result in dozens of lives ruined or ended at a single stroke. Love ends more easily than it begins. Even the most noble of revolutions can descend into tyranny. These ruthless mages give the Pygmalian Society the bad reputation it currently suffers among the Awakened.</div><div>True Pygmalians are much more than the terrorists and instigators of chaos that other mages often believe the Sculptors to be. True Pygmalians are artists, and more than that: they think they know the means by which the entire human race can one day Awaken.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Sculptors",
        "orders": "All five of the great mystical orders have Pygmalian members, but more than half of them of the Sculptors end up in the Free Council (if they join an order at all). The first Pygmalians all belonged to the Free Council, and, although the Legacy is not intimately connected to the order, the line of tutor to pupil frequently ensures that new Pygmalians join the Free Council in turn, or belonged to the order in the first place. The Free Council is certainly the order that is most amenable to radical social and intellectual change as a means to Awaken humanity. The less-regulated Free Council is also the order most likely to accept a Pygmalian despite the Legacy’s checkered reputation. <div>The four Atlantean orders all have a few Pygmalians. The Silver Ladder’s stated aim for the Awakening of the human race attracts a fair number of Sculptors, but these mages often find themselves frustrated by the order’s strict and convoluted hierarchy.</div><div>The Mysterium, with its emphasis on acquiring mystical knowledge, is fairly accommodating, since the Pygmalians are often expert at interpreting the past, connecting it to the present and suggesting implications for the future. Mundane and magical archeology can give the facts about what people did, but an artist’s insight into human emotions can suggest why.</div><div>Of the old orders, the Guardians of the Veil and the Adamantine Arrow attract the fewest Sculptors. The Guardians don’t generally tolerate the meddling of Pygmalians who try too hard to change human affairs; however, a few of the more subtle Sculptors do find a home among the Guardians. Meanwhile, the Arrows sometimes attract some of the more martially inclined Pygmalians. These Sculptors are respected by other mages within the order, but rarely trusted, and it’s often these Pygmalians who fall into violence as a means of effecting change.</div>",
        "appearance": "Like Sleeper artists, Pygmalians are as easy to recognize as they choose to be. Some follow clichés such as the Galois-smoking bohemian with his beret, straight from the Left Bank of Paris, or the intellectual sophisticate clad all in basic black. More Sculptors just look like ordinary, middle-class people. Their manner gives a truer guide. Whoever Sculptors might be, they speak and act passionately. Sometimes, they slide into melodrama that makes cooler-tempered people wince or shake their heads. Subtler mannerisms and an attention to details of the Sculptors’ surroundings make Sleepers think the Sculptors ought to be artists, even if they wear exactly the same clothes as the people standing next to them.",

This includes every possible expression of art: novelists, painters, poets, performance artists, musicians, architects, filmmakers, stand-up comedians and DJs are all represented among the Pygmalians. They are not necessarily professional artists. Occasionally, an individual who is not usually considered an artist — a mathematician, a software developer or even a soldier or a politician — joins the Legacy. As long as someone considers what she does to be an art, and is passionate about it, the person is eligible to join.<div>Pygmalians also know their art isn’t enough. Their promise is unfulfilled, and they all want more. Most Pygmalians are just talented enough to realize that they’re not quite talented enough to change the world through their chosen media.

        "organizzation": "The Pygmalian Society has little or no formal organization. Pygmalians have no central authority and recognize no precedence other than the respect due teachers from their pupils. Tutors and pupils seem to find each other without trying. Training can vary greatly in intensity and style. One tutor, for example, teaches two or three pupils at a time, holding regular and highly formal classes, where he imparts the mystical knowledge of the tradition in a theoretical, academic form and leaves his pupils to perfect the Legacy’s attainments in their own time, as “homework.” Another tutor disappears from her pupil’s life for weeks on end, turning up apparently according to whim. She spends a few days alongside her pupil, accompanying the less experienced mage through the beginning of each new stage, before vanishing again, leaving the pupil to work out what to do with his new knowledge on his own. Still another tutor demands that he move into his pupil’s home, taking over his unfortunate apprentice’s entire life in order to make a real Sculptor out of her.<div>Whatever the method, all Pygmalian tutors allow their pupils freedom in their choice of Art form (no matter what their personal opinions of its validity as a medium might be). Although it’s common for a tutor to take a pupil who works on the same kind of Art, it’s not universal.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>The Pygmalian Society has its origins in the Wars of the Roses, a series of schisms and mystical conflicts between a number of mystical groups (particularly Rosicrucians) in 19th-century Paris. The conflict seems unthinkable today, but was widely reported in the Parisian press at the time, since several well-known people of the day were involved. The factions in the “Wars” were mostly composed of Sleepers. A few Awakened were also present, indulging their own schisms and conflicts under cover of the very public and, to them, trivial arguments of their unwitting Sleeper colleagues. </div><div>One of these mages was Patrice Cajean. Born penniless in Brittany in the late 1860s, Cajean Awakened as a teenager into a nightmare of swirling sounds and colors. By the end of the 1880s, Cajean, through a combination of charm, talent and Awakened magic, reinvented himself as a figure of urbanity and wit. He became a popular figure in the bohemian salons of fin de siècle Paris. </div><div>Through his powers, Cajean was no stranger to the formal mysticism of the Paris sects. He found himself drawn to one particular Rosicrucian splinter group. This group declared that Art was a great mystery, a great empire and a great miracle, and that Artists were hence the secret kings, priests and magicians of the world. Cajean wondered if there was something to this theory. Although he felt contempt for of the importance this faction attached to its petty squabbles, Cajean investigated the possibility that Art was in fact a small form of magic, a link between human beings and the Supernal World (which Cajean, inspired by Neoplatonist philosophy, identified as the Divine Principle, or the Godhead). He posited that when God said, “let there be light,” He created Art through pure inspiration, distilled into creation by an act of will. </div><div>Cajean investigated ways to harness this true, inspired creativity. He believed he could manipulate human history through Art, planting some ideas and stifling others to weaken the Lie. Just about everyone could appreciate some sort of Art; so Cajean believed he could Awaken everyone through this slender thread connecting their souls to the Supernal World. The project might take a century or more, but an Acanthus mage is not discouraged by time. </div><div>A few other mages thought Cajean had a good idea. Cajean pictured himself as a new Pygmalion, breathing life into the Fallen World’s lifeless images of the True Forms, so he called his formal and highly ritualized cabal of like-minded mages the Pygmalian Society. His magical program for mass Awakening depended upon communication and control, on ascertaining the intricate web of connections between the soul and other souls, between the soul and the past, present and future. To the Legacy’s existing skill at Fate and Time, the Legacy’s founders added a deep study of Mind, in order to gain a precise knowledge of how the arts could manipulate thoughts and emotions. They had no real plan, though — just a deep faith in the transformative power of Art. </div><div>Cajean’s first pupil, Marcus Naismith, was an Englishman. He brought the Pygmalian Society into the English-speaking world. Naismith’s own take on the Legacy’s magic was influenced by his great love of the philosophy and art of the visionary poet and engraver William Blake. English-speaking Pygmalians in particular have used Blakean language to describe their magic and rituals ever since. </div><div>A member of the Society last saw Patrice Cajean alive in March of 1916. Right up to the end of his life, Cajean felt the need to live among the ordinary people he longed to see reunited with the Godhead. He believed a Supernal inspiration brought the human race to the Great War: patriotic fervor and the need to prove the courage of nations led the entire world into a storm of death, plague and famine. Cajean knew the Great War would shatter the age of European colonial empires, with possibilities for great Good and terrifying Evil opening up through the rest of the century. The idealistic mage hoped to avert the horrors of the Great War and its aftermath, but could not stand to hide in a secure sanctum far from harm. He needed to share the danger and the struggle. Cajean failed; he died in the fighting at Verdun, wearing the face of a man 30 years his junior. </div><div>In the years after the Great War, the Pygmalian Society fragmented. Without Cajean’s charisma to temper the remaining founders’ personal quarrels, they drifted apart. Art was changing, too. New movements such as futurism, cubism, and Dada brought new ideas and new Pygmalians who had little time for a structured organization. They preferred to use the Legacy in their own way. By World War II, “Pygmalians” had ceased to be anything more than a catch-all term for those mages who crafted their souls in the tradition of Patrice Cajean, and the Pygmalians have resisted formal organization ever since. Their methods and Art have changed, but they still hold true to Patrice Cajean’s faith in the Supernal power of Art.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>The first principles of the Pygmalian Society grew out of Western occult traditions. Although most Pygmalians don’t dress up their magic in the formal principles of Rosicrucian practice any more, the study of their attainments shows the influence of a very European style of mysticism, with a special nod to William Blake. They still use much of Patrice Cajean’s language. Most Pygmalians still refer to the Supernal as the “Godhead,” for example; they call their goal of universal Awakening the “Reconciliation,” or the “Marriage of Heaven and Hell.”</div><div>As a corollary, most Pygmalians practice European styles of creative Art. Awakened artists representing non-Western artistic forms (such as African woodcarving, for example, or Japanese verse) seldom find their way into the Pygmalian Society. If such artists-mages do get the opportunity to join, it’s generally because they try to practice their art in a Western context; for example, a member of a group of Indian musicians performing in New York state art centers. </div><div>Apart from the relationship between tutors and their pupils, Pygmalians aren’t known for working together. They don’t hold to any network, and they don’t recognize any obligations to each other above and beyond that normally expected because of membership in a cabal or a mystical order. </div><div>As Artists, the Pygmalians have more than their fair share of self-publicists in their number. They tend to become well known among the mystical orders, particularly among Consilii in Western Europe and in urbanized areas of the United States. Many more mages hear about Pygmalian mages than actually meet them. Unfortunately, the greatest self-publicists among the Pygmalians are often those who went wrong. Many mages who know about Pygmalians by reputation don’t even realize that they’re Artists, and imagine instead that they are a Legacy of terrorists or lunatics. </div><div>The wide variation among the methods and styles of the Pygmalians often means that this assessment goes unchallenged. Most Sculptors don’t care in the end what other mages think. The nature of the Sculptors’ goal is such that they care more about the Sleepers, anyway. </div><div>A Pygmalian mage surrounds herself with Sleepers — talented, passionate people who achieve more than simple talk, never art-school poseurs. She does her absolute level best to become a conduit of inspiration for the extraordinary people around her. At best, a Sculptor tries to drive her companions to create something special, something fantastic. It’s not the mage’s own role to change things. No great invention or epochmaking artwork has ever been made by a mage: it’s the way that the Fallen World works. The Pygmalians recognize that this is the Sleepers’ world, and the Sleepers have to change it. </div><div>The credit for great art never belongs to the Sculptor. All he does is attempt to contribute through magic and other arts to an environment where genius can flourish; creation can occur only through inspiration. Simply to give ideas to an artist is not enough. True genius can work with secondhand materials (you only need to look at the work of Shakespeare and Mozart to see that), but great artists transform their sources in unique, inspired ways. What the Sculptor tries to do is simply be there and guide his Artists to find the Godhead themselves. He’s a lover, a companion, a patron, a friend, sometimes a rival or an enemy. Sometimes, loneliest of all, he’s an unattainable figure in the distance that haunts his Artists’ steps. Whatever role he takes, he’s a muse and a catalyst for the real Artist and the real work. </div><div>The Pygmalian’s goal is to create the conditions through which the Reconciliation can happen. Any incursion of magic, any minor half-Awakening is enough. It doesn’t matter if there isn’t a specific plan as such. If enough of these small victories are won, the mages of the Pygmalian Society are confident that, one day, the Marriage of Heaven and Hell will take place and everyone will Awaken.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Tygers of Wrath Are Wiser Than the Horses of Instruction</h3><div>Art is a dangerous thing. The Pygmalian Society recognizes this, but, at the same time, the Legacy’s lack of organization means that the group has no checks and balances. The freedom of its members to find any way at all to create art can become a trap of Hubris. While fallen Pygmalians have been few, a Sculptor gone wrong can have a terrible influence on the world around her. </div><div>These fallen Sculptors are Jonahs. Chaos surrounds them. When they’re nearby, relationships collapse. Families tear apart. Cars crash. Crops fail. Diseases break out. Buildings explode. Riots erupt. Governments lose their grip. Wars start. People die. </div><div>The most notorious of these Sculptors was Enoch Christopher, a Welsh poet who joined the Pygmalian Society in 1936. Christopher, influenced by the futurists, composed puzzling non-linear works that, thanks to his mastery of Pygmalian magic, held his manifesto encoded within them: true inspiration requires conflict. Anger, grief and terror open artists to Supernal truth and goad them to the heights of self-expression. Christopher believed that if his Art was to have any chance of bringing about real transformation, the Art had to be unfettered by any limits of scale or morality. </div><div>This manifesto of change through violence has cropped up, quite independently, on a number of occasions. These Pygmalians might not openly say so to begin with, but they share the assumption that human beings are just raw clay for the Sculptor’s Art. Some Sculptors begin to directly manipulate lives. The more powerful among them tear up human memories and put them back together like a Burroughsian cut-up, using trauma to drive their victims to action. </div><div>Some Pygmalians become equally cavalier with themselves. They alter their own minds, messing with everything from taste in clothes right through to sexual orientation, even temporarily rebuilding their own memories in order to become their grand Artwork and, through the inspiration they gain, alter the world. It’s not healthy to become close to Pygmalians who works like this. Everything goes wrong around them, as they engineer conflict in their own lives. They manipulate people around them to create lovers, enemies, tragedies, accidents and obstacles to overcome — often without even informing themselves that they’re doing it. For instance, a Sculptor creates an alternate personality to fall in love, then the master personality kills the lover so the other self can experience true loss. </div><div>Enoch Christopher himself died in the late 1980s, a notorious harbinger of disaster. He had become possibly the best-known Pygmalian who had ever lived, almost singlehandedly responsible for the Pygmalian Society’s bad name. The original manuscript copy of Christopher’s 1939 collection of “automatic poetry,” When I Came Back It Was Gone, still exists and is a powerful, spontaneously generated Artifact in its own right. The revisions and alterations contained in this sheaf of yellowing paper hold frightening secrets and great power along with cold, brutal resonance.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>The Pygmalian Society sets few requirements for its members. Pygmalians are Awakened and Artists. All have that desire, that need, to make a powerful difference to creation. </div><div>The Pygmalians have no hard rules for choosing their pupils. Some Pygmalians seek particular individuals; others wait for pupils to come to them. Time seems to play tricks on new Pygmalians, and many even experience their first initiation before deciding to join the order, or even knowing that they’re being initiated — which is just as well, since, given the Legacy’s terrible reputation, very few mages would actually join without some kind of revelation as to what the Pygmalian Society really is.</div><div>In his induction, the mage enters a deep coma. Initiation plays out as a hyper-real dream in which the mage, placed in the surroundings of his mind’s eye, is forced to undergo an ordeal of some kind. Ordeals vary, but they are always deadly serious, and sometimes just deadly: the new Pygmalian might have to endure what seems like a week-long ritual dance, survive a crucifixion or experience being tattooed all over his body. In the ordeal, the Pygmalian is guided or hindered (or both) by a visionary figure who will return in each of the Pygmalian’s initiatory ordeals. Sometimes, this figure is a mirror image of the Pygmalian, a past self or a potential future self. Sometimes, the guide is a sexual complement of the Pygmalian, a perfect “other half” of the opposite gender to the initiate (or, if the initiate is gay, the same gender). Sometimes, the guide is an entirely different figure, perhaps one of the regular cast of the initiate’s dreams elevated to the position of spokesperson. Sometimes, the guide is a mythical or literary figure: anything from a Grail-questing knight to a talking animal that leads the mage down a rabbit hole.</div><div>When the ordeal is over, the Pygmalian returns to consciousness and the real world. There is always some anomaly that suggests that the ordeal was not a dream. A Pygmalian who endures being tattooed wakes up with a small tattoo on her face. A Pygmalian who endures crucifixion in his vision wakes up with small scars on his hands, feet and sides. Another Pygmalian finds small objects or items of jewellery belonging to her mage’s guide in her pockets. On the other hand, a Pygmalian who fails his initiation usually has no memory of what happened, and is likely to be found very ill, or with broken bones or just covered from head-to-toe with bruises or superficial burns.</div><div>Although every Pygmalian tutor teaches his pupils in his own way, the substance of the teaching is fairly constant: pupils are taught the Pygmalian philosophy of Art. At the same time, Pygmalian pupils receive absolute freedom with what they do with the teaching, how they express their Art and whom they choose to guide in turn. </div><div>In each subsequent initiation, the Pygmalian undergoes another hallucinatory ordeal, and, each time, gains another sign that the ordeal was more than simply a dream. These dream-ordeals, however, are not spontaneous unless the Sculptor has cut her tie to her tutor and decided to craft her soul without further help. Soulcrafting for the second and third attainments involves a preparatory ritual. Each tutor and pupil design a unique ritual to induce the initiatory vision, but the ceremony uses paraphernalia drawn from Western magical traditions. Depending on the tutor, this could involve robes or nakedness, magic circles, wands, knives and the like.</div><div>Shortly before Cajean’s death, he underwent a fourth ordeal. He told one of his pupils that he had learned the truth about where these visions came from and who the visionary figures really are. He died before he could lead anyone else to the fourth attainment. If any other Pygmalians have reached the fourth ordeal by themselves, they’ve kept quiet about what they learned.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Induction Before Choice</h3><div>Many Pygmalians say they had their initiatory ordeal before they decided to join the Legacy, and their initiatory ordeal guided them to their tutors. That’s only partly accurate: Acanthus mages take a free and easy view of Time, but even they don’t engage in rampant causality violation.</div><div>Unconsciously, an Acanthus mage’s soul can see the possible futures and the option of joining the Pygmalians. The soul induces the initiatory coma; mind and soul have their dialogue and reach a conclusion. The soulcrafting is not complete, however. Unless the nascent Pygmalian has a Gnosis of 4 or higher, he still needs a tutor’s help to “lock in” his soul’s new shape.</div>",

Many mages are surprised that the powers the Pygmalians cultivate above all others are so indirect. The Pygmalians work to master Time and Fate, like other Acanthus, but add to this a superior understanding of the mysteries of Mind. Through this Arcanum, they manipulate emotion, sense and memory for the purpose of guiding others to their own inspiration. </div><div>Pygmalian magic is subtle, hidden in passionate words or flamboyant gestures that are not obviously magical in and of themselves. Many Pygmalians, particularly those who perform in some way, learn how to use their Art as a vehicle for their magic (especially for extended spellcasting).

        "firstAttainmentDescription": "<div>The first thing the aspiring Pygmalian learns is how to direct emotions through the manipulation of human senses. Smells, sounds, tastes and colors — or their implanted memories — can alter someone’s mood for good or ill, reminding a subject or a group of people of whatever emotion the mage wants them to experience. This attainment produces an effect more or less identical to the Mind 2 rote “Sculpt the Heart” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 208), but using a contested roll of Manipulation + Expression + Mind versus the subject’s Composure + Gnosis.</div><div>The mage’s own senses are affected too. By examining the sensory reflection of the emotions dredged up from his subjects’ memories, the mage can perceive the weave of connections existing between the people he affects and the people around them. The links of emotion and Fate manifest as a kind of synesthesia, with emotional smells, tastes, sounds or colors becoming apparent to the mage as he examines the web of association around him. In game terms, this works as the Fate 1 spell “Interconnections” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 148). As a minor side effect, the mage permanently becomes a synesthete, with tastes, colors, smells and sounds mixed up in his perceptions. Many Pygmalians see this as a benefit, citing Shakespeare and Kandinsky as examples of inspiration through synesthesia.</div><div>The mage can bring about the memory of feeling through simple conversation, or through the medium of his Art (for example, by means of a musical performance, a stand-up gig or a gallery showing at which the mage is present). The effect does not always have to be direct. Calming words can, for example, be used to hide an infuriating subtext (in the manner of a “friends, Romans, countrymen” speech).</div><div>If they can, Pygmalians use this power on groups of people rather than individuals, since the more people the Pygmalians can affect, the more information they can glean about their interconnections.</div><div>Sometimes, a Pygmalian uses this power on herself. She might feel she needs to force herself to do something frightening or emotionally painful. She might want to make herself play a role with true sincerity, or she could simply want to feel something. Even though the mage uses this power on a willing subject (i.e., herself), she still makes a reflexive roll of Composure + Gnosis to resist; the mage might be willing, but, subconsciously, her soul perceives this as an intrusion and fights back. The mage can, however, reduce her resistance dice pool by spending Mana, thus suppressing her natural reactions with magical brute force: each point of Mana spent reduces the Composure + Gnosis pool by 1.</div>",

        "secondAttainmentDescription": "<div>The Pygmalians develop their understanding of sensory and emotional manipulation further by learning how to imbue their actions or their performances with complex meaning. This works in a manner similar to the Mind 3 rote “Bricks of Babel” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 213), but using a roll of Intelligence + Expression + Mind. Pygmalians who achieve this second attainment can communicate complex concepts and messages in a few brief, insignificant movements, or say one thing and communicate something completely different to the recipient. The mage can choose whether to communicate his message to an individual or to a group (use the modifiers for casting spells on more than one target; see Mage: The Awakening p. 118); the mage can also choose whether the recipients of the message actually realize that they’ve received a message from him, rather than simply having thoughts pop into their heads.</div><div>The second attainment can be used in conjunction with the first. After succeeding with an application of Arrows of Desire, the mage’s player makes another roll to apply the first attainment to the message. If the roll is successful, the message has the added effect of affecting the recipient’s emotions.</div><div>A skillful and lucky Pygmalian who uses the second attainment and the first in quick succession can move crowds of people to believe nearly anything. However, these attainments do not work over radio, television or recorded media — the Sculptor must be “live and in person.”</div>",

Sometimes, a Pygmalian needs to know the immediate results of two or three choices. A Pygmalian mage who is also a Disciple of Time can fold herself into her own short-term memory, bodily pulling herself moments into the past in the same way as the Time 3 spell, “Shifting Sands” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 263).</div><div>A Pygmalian knowing this spell or ancillary attainment often repeats it, over and over, as he examines all the possible results of his decisions. This can be dangerous, since, similar to the “Shifting Sands” spell, anything that happens to the mage still happens, because the mage, in going back, actually displaces his earlier self from the timestream. </div><div>Sculptors who do this often may experience strange sensations at entirely random intervals, shuddery, cold sort of feelings, like sudden flashbacks of dying.</div>",

        "thirdAttainmentDescription": "<div>Pygmalians who reach the third attainment find that, while the secret of inspiration is still, frustratingly, just out of their grasp, they can, at the very least, produce the conditions for revelation to happen. Through the manipulation of memory, a mage with this attainment can make a single subject experience an epiphany, a sudden understanding of some past event, or a false memory of some inspirational, life-changing experience. Depending on the event the mage chooses, this experience can be healing or traumatic. In game terms, this works like the Mind 4 spell “Breach the Vault of Memory” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 214) with the same contested roll of Gnosis + Mind versus the subject’s Resolve + Gnosis. </div><div>The revelation doesn’t last very long (usually no more than a scene — see the spell description in Mage: The Awakening, then apply the number of successes rolled to the Extended Spellcasting Duration chart for prolonged spells on p. 120 of that book), but the revelation’s indirect effects last. Even when the subject recognizes that her memories of love, divine revelation or childhood trauma were delusions, she still recalls what it felt like to remember these things. The memory of feeling is not feeling, but often is enough to drive a creative individual to cathartic action. A novelist given a taste of bitter love writes a powerful story of loss and desire. A painter is driven to a masterpiece by the memory of a unique face.</div><div>Pygmalians often bolster the effect, repeating it or prolonging it with the use of the first and second attainments. Pygmalians also use this power on themselves. Again, a Sculptor might want believe utterly in his adopted role or experience someone else’s trauma, or even to experience that madness said to be close to genius. Similar to the first attainment, a Pygmalian using this power on himself still has to make a reflexive resistance roll, this time Resolve + Gnosis (per “Breach the Vault of Memory”). He can spend Mana to force the power on himself. Pygmalians using this power often have no idea what they’re doing when under their own influence. Some Pygmalians can even take on three entirely separate roles in a day, all the time unaware of the actions of their other selves.</div>",

This works exactly like the Time 4 spell, “Prophecy” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 264).</div><div>The answer is never direct. It comes as a feeling, an emotion, supplemented by synesthetic sensory experiences (heard colors, tasted sounds). The mage, thinking over the options, suddenly knows what feels right, and takes the opportunity to act on that intuition. </div>"

For the Scions of God, however, the fakery isn’t fake. Their eerie and elaborate masks and costumes evoke a divine power that makes them more than human.</div><div>All mages know their souls have touched the Supernal World and yearn for that realm as their true home. The human ego, on the other hand, is a creature of the Astral Plane. But what of the Shadow Realm? Mages can visit the spirit plane through magic, but humans are not truly at home there. The Scions of God believe this omission helps lock humans into the Fallen World. Humans can ascend from the material plane more easily, the Scions of God say, if the humans exist in all four worlds at once: physical body, Supernal soul, Astral mind and ephemeral spirit. The Scions of God call this fourth entity the Holy Guardian Angel and try to make it the vehicle for both mind and soul.</div><div>The Legacy began during the Age of Exploration, when Europe’s willworkers encountered African, Asian and Native American mages. The natives used masks to become vessels for gods and spirits: the Sleepers only in play-acting, the mages in truth. Even in the tribal dances and superstitious rites of the Sleepers, however, the explorers felt the breath of the Supernal World. They realized that some masks don’t conceal the truth, they reveal it.</div><div>When the explorers returned home, a few mages tried using masks and costumes for their own ends. Their experiments gave some Silver Ladder mages new ideas about spirit-dealings and their own souls. The mage who first used masks to craft his own soul used the jargon of Kabbalism, so he called his divine persona his Holy Guardian Angel. His followers took the name of an order of angels, the Bene Elohim. The new Legacy eventually spread beyond Europe and absorbed elements from Hinduism, voodoo and other religions. As the Bene Elohim became more multicultural, members preferred to use its vulgate name, the Sons of God. During the 20th century, the Legacy changed its name to the gender-neutral Scions of God. Not only did the Legacy include as many women as men, but some members that found their Holy Guardian Angels apparently had different genders from themselves.</div><div>The Legacy’s goals and methods, however, have not changed much. Scions of God conduct rituals of worship in costumes that show how they see their Holy Guardian Angels — the transcendent selves the Scions want to be. Hieraticrobes speak of priestly power, though Scions are priests of no Sleeper faith. A mask suggests a more than human essence: priest and god in the same person. Even when a Scion doesn’t wear this costume, her nimbus manifests its appearance whenever she performs vulgar magic. In the Shadow Realm, a Scion always looks like her mask — but real and alive.</div><div>Scions of God want to purge themselves of human weakness and become incarnate angels, true spirits of the Supernal World. Some Scions hope that when they die, their fortified and tempered souls can Ascend to the Supernal World, to join the war against the Exarchs. Other Scions seek to become lords among spirits. While living, the Scions serve as gatekeepers between the worlds, expelling unruly spirits but encouraging spirits friendly to humanity. Other mages appreciate the Scions’ power to locate and command spirits.Like the other members of the Silver Ladder, the Scions want to give Creation a righteous order. For the Masquers, this includes greater contact between mortals and spirits. The Masquers hope that Sleepers who experience the supernatural may become Sleepwalkers, or even Awaken, and come to understand their Supernal birthright. Scions tell the spirits that they, too, are trapped in a Fallen World and denied contact with a greater reality. The Scions dream of building an army of spirits and mortals to storm across the Abyss and throw down the false gods. This may take a thousand years, but it shall be done.</div>",

        "orders": "The Scions of God formed within the Silver Ladder; many Scions consider themselves shining exemplars of their order’s ideals. In return, other members of the Silver Ladder respect the Scions’ superb rapport with the Shadow Realm, even if their methods seem odd and flamboyant. Adamantine Arrow mages like to have a Masquer join them on forays into the Shadow Realm, while the Mysterium values the Scions’ inside view of the spirit courts. Guardians of the Veil, however, often wince at the Masquers’ willingness to use Spirit magic in front of Sleepers. Free Council mages used to think the Bene Elohim were just kooks playing dress-up; in return, Scions thought Free Council mages lacked moral gravity and respect for tradition. However, new Sleeper ideas about transhumanism prompt the Council to give the Scions another look. A few Council mages try to update and adapt Scion methods. These Free Council mages hope to become immortal spirits, using virtual reality simulations and digital avatars instead of masks and robes — and perhaps someday they shall succeed.",
        "appearance": "Scions of God wear elaborate “working costumes” when they assert their identities as divine spirits. A Scion’s hieratic garb usually includes a sleeved cloak with embroidered bands around the hems, flaring collars (maybe more than one) and a large amulet as a clasp, a headdress of some sort and a sash around the waist. Some Scions stick to the scholar’s gown of the medieval magician, a priest’s cassock or the robe of an Egyptian priest. Other Scions wear a loose, comfortable shirt and trousers, or a blouse and skirt, but often they emblazon these garments with symbolic designs.<div>The mask, however, is the Legacy’s defining accoutrement. More traditional Scions wear the stylized faces of lions, bulls, eagles, serpents or other animals with mythic associations — something Scion believe express the true faces of their souls. A Scion’s mask may look quite different, though. Scion masks range from the beautiful human faces members would like to show the world to highly abstract masks with no human features at all. Members of the Legacy who possess only their first attainment line their cloaks with sky-blue silk. Second-degree Scions use a white lining. Masquers who achieve the third attainment wear gold. Scions may embroider their ceremonial garb with other signs indicating mastery of particular Arcana or other achievements, but such symbols are traditional for mages in general (and the Silver Ladder in particular), and not mandatory for any Masquer.</div>",
        "background": "The sheer megalomania of the Scions’ goal attracts mages of great ambition (Pride is a common Vice) or great dissatisfaction with themselves. Some Scions brushed the spirit world before their Awakening and felt the need to understand that realm better.<div>The Scions’ methods, however, demand great patience from prospective members: the initiation alone takes 40 days of fasting, prayer and purification rituals. A Masquer also needs at least a two-dot Sanctum to hold a special oratory. The Bene Elohim can differ in just about everything else, but none demand instant gratification.</div>",
        "organizzation": "The Bene Elohim don’t need much administration or hierarchy beyond what the Silver Ladder already provides. The Legacy is sufficiently small that the personal authority of its senior members suffices to organize meetings and resolve disputes, without the need for any special titles or offices. Most Scions operate apart from other Masquers, and freely join cabals with other mages. A Scion visits her tutor whenever she needs advice or training, and tutors are as likely as other mentors to demand assistance from their students, but the Legacy doesn’t insist they associate at other times.<div>The Scions do not grant titles for their first or second attainments. Mages who achieve the third attainment are called Archangels. </div><div>Tradition holds that once a year, each Archangel should host a Conventicle, an open-house gathering for any member who wants to attend. These parties do not give the Bene Elohim any more loyalty to each other than is usual for mages, but at least they know each other better than other mages guess. Rote swaps and other contracts between Masquers often take place at Conventicles, where other Scions can watch and make sure both mages deal honestly. </div>",
        "suggestedOblations": "A Scion of God gains Mana from celebrating a Mass in honor of her Holy Guardian Angel, either in her oratory or any sort of church or temple. The Bene Elohim may also gain Mana through exchanges of gifts with spirits (other than familiars), attending spirit courts and being treated as a spirit themselves or persuading spirit to accept the Masquers’ authority without the need for magical compulsion.",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>Mages have always studied the techniques of their neighbors. When Europe’s great Age of Exploration began during the 15th century, anthropologically-minded mages in the Silver Ladder and Mysterium became particularly active in this respect.</div><div>Padre Matteo Lorca, known to the Sleepers as a Franciscan missionary to India, became the first European mage to study mask-magic in depth. Late in the 17th century, Lorca used his knowledge of Indian exorcist masks to banish a cholera-demon that had already slain two other mages. Lorca’s success inspired several other mages to investigate the magical and ceremonial uses of masks.</div><div>Lorca’s own apprentice Rios Barjuan, a.k.a. Adriel, tried using masks to summon angels. He hoped that, just as an ordinary mask could make a Sleeper feel he was a vessel for a god or spirit, an enchanted mask could help a mage commune with an angel. Adriel did not seek one of the shining but limited “angels” found in the Shadow Realm: he sought to call one of the glorious, enigmatic spirits occasionally reported by awestruck mages — spirits who seemed to ignore all the rules of the Shadow Realm and have no known habitation, whose terrible power surely marked them as emissaries of the Supernal. Adriel failed and the putative True Angels remain legendary to this day. Barjuan did not consider his research wasted, though. Along the way, Adriel discovered how to combine masks with certain Kabbalist theories of the soul and initiatory rites to develop a new method of soulcrafting. He could not summon an angel, but perhaps he could become one.</div><div>Adriel became one of the Silver Ladder’s top exorcists. The order’s chronicles credit him with destroying a nest of spirits corrupted and enthralled by an Abyssal horror. He also reformed (or transformed) the war-devil Sergulath back into one of the lower sort of angels; this martial spirit now guards one of the Silver Ladder’s largest sanctums in Europe. Adriel’s power attracted disciples who eventually grew into a recognized Legacy, the Bene Elohim.</div><div>Adriel’s Legacy remained small until the 19th century. A revival of interest in Kabbalism among Sleeper occultists led to, or was caused by, greater interest in this tradition by the Awakened — as usual, historically-minded mages argue over who influenced whom. The 19th century also saw mages in India, China and other lands copying the Bene Elohim soulcrafting, without the elements of Judeo-Christian mysticism. Since dialogue with these foreign mages helped refine the Legacy’s methods, increasing numbers of Bene Elohim thought it was only good manners to downplay the use of Hebrew.</div><div>The Sons of God suddenly came into prominence during World War I. As the Great War ground on and became more bitter, some cabals of mages took sides — and tried to draw their own spiritual allies into the conflict. The Great War almost spilled into the Shadow Realm, with what consequences no one could guess. The masters of the Legacy forbade this spiritual escalation. Around the world, Bene Elohim forced peace between the spirits of different magical factions and separated militaristic mages from their spirit allies. The Masquers made powerful enemies during those years, but gained great respect from many mages in the Silver Ladder and the Guardians of the Veil.</div><div>The Bene Elohim, now Scions of God, remain one of the smaller Legacies associated with the Silver Ladder. The Legacy’s leaders have not issued any recent declarations to their colleagues in magic, or intervened in any Sleeper conflicts. The Scions of God seem content to act as individuals, each Scion mediating between Sleepers and spirits in her own way. The Scions have some common interests, but no common goal. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>The Masquers believe in a Supreme Being — Yahweh, Brahman, the name doesn’t matter — who fashioned all the worlds and the spirits within them. The Scions do not doubt the existence of Atlantis, but wonder how well modern mages really understand the mythic fount of magic. Like the Garden of Eden, they say, Atlantis serves as a myth for the ruin of a divine, primal order.</div><div>In the beginning, the Scions say, humans knew their own divinity as children of the Creator and experienced the Shadow Realm as freely as the material world. When the Exarchs broke reality, they also broke mortals’ connection to the Shadow Realm. The Scions say their masked rituals and meditations draw the mind and soul closer together as a single, divine self, with the Holy Guardian Angel to bind them together. The masks and costumes create an Imago for this spiritual body; the prayers and rituals in the oratory help the soul charge that Imago with spiritual power. The soulcrafting process cements the union. Each attainment marks a stronger bond between mind, spirit and soul.</div><div>A closer union between mind, soul and spiritual self does more than create a mage better able to work in the spirit world. A close union re-creates an entity that can cross the Abyss and carry the soul home — an entity a lot more powerful than the Exarchs usually encounter. The united soul becomes an angel, or even a god (as the Fallen World knows gods, at least). What’s more, every united soul draws the material, spiritual and Supernal worlds a little closer together. The Masquers say that healing the Abyss and restoring humanity to its Supernal birthright obviously must take precedence over the petty distractions of the Fallen World. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Laws of Angels</h3><div>The Bene Elohim list politics and administration among those distractions, and so the Masquers avoid the elaborate grades, hierarchies and bylaws found in many Awakened societies. The Scions restrict their bylaws to a few pages of guidelines about what contact between mortals and spirits causes harm and what the Scions should encourage. In brief, the Scions approve of spirits that help humans and bend their minds toward Supernal matters. The Scions don’t like spirits that harm or exploit humans, or that encourage sordid, worldly appetites. Some demons and devils deserve pity, though a Scion still must defeat them: these spirits cannot help their fallen state. Abyssal spirits such as the acamoth, however, must be fought without mercy.</div><div>The Scions adopt a similar policy with regard to non–Scion mages. The Scions say that right is right and wrong is wrong, and anyone who’s honest with himself knows the difference. Mages who use their powers for bad purposes must be stopped. Mages who consciously choose evil, such as the Scelesti, must be stopped hard. Scions of high Wisdom avoid obnoxious priggery by placing people above abstract principles. After all, every Sleeper is an angelic soul not yet Awakened to its true nature. Sleepers’ lives and enlightenment matter more than the letter of any law. Masquers sometimes annoy more pragmatic mages with the Scions’ refusal to compromise their high-flown ideals, but Scions with high Wisdom often win respect for their moral clarity and altruistic courage.</div><div>Scions can fall to Hubris just like any other mage, though. Holiness becomes holier-than-thou arrogance and contempt for anyone who doesn’t defer to the Scions’ “angelic” moral purity. When other mages express doubts about the ethics of a Scion’s actions, a Hubris-riddled Scion often claims to serve “a greater good beyond your sight.” After all, when you know you’re an angel on a mission from God, any decision you make must be correct.</div><div>Scions treat each other with great formality when they meet. After ritual phrases of greeting, the Scions list their attainments (if not obvious from their cloaks), Paths and tutors’ names. Bene Elohim can loosen up with other mages they know well, but, when there’s magic to be done, the Scions become utterly formal once more. Wielding divine power is serious business.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Angels of Ascension</h3><div>The Bene Elohim keep few secrets. Their doctrines and descriptions of their rituals are freely available, at least to other members of the Silver Ladder. (Their rotes are another matter: the Scions are no more ready than any other mages to give away rotes they invented.) Indeed, many Scions welcome a chance to talk about something other mages might keep a dark secret.</div><div>Death is not always the end for Scions who reach the third attainment. Archangels often become spirits after their corporeal death: the Holy Guardian Angel sheds the material body, and carries the mage’s intact ego into the Shadow Realm. A Scion’s personality simplifies when he becomes a spirit, but Bene Elohim don’t suffer the mad obsessions that afflict ghost-mages. The Legacy’s deceased members remain actively involved with their living colleagues; some dead mages continue as mentors to junior Scions (though such mages cannot soulcraft and death still breaks the mystical bond between tutor and pupil). Deceased Archangels sometimes attend Conventicles. They often join spirit courts, or even run their own. When an Archangel doesn’t become a spirit after death, the other Scions presume she immediately ascended to carry the fight to the Exarchs. The Bene Elohim point to their deceased-but-still-active membership as evidence that the Scions know the true path to Ascension. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Light to the Shadow Realm</h3><div>The Scions of God believe their status as Supernal entities makes them stewards of the Shadow Realm as well as the human world. Stewardship means more than mastery. In the beginning, the Scions say, all spirits were good. The division of the worlds deformed the spirits, until some became demons of horror. Even the worst devil of the Shadow Realm, however, can be redeemed through Supernal intervention — namely, sufficiently powerful Spirit magic. Great Scions, such as their founder Adriel, have, indeed, turned hostile spirits into friends of humanity.</div><div>The Scions want more interaction between Sleepers and spirits, but this must take place in the right manner. Silver Ladder mages espouse competing visions of what “the right manner” means, so the Masquers do as well; but they agree that a proper relationship between mortals and spirits benefits both sides. The Sleepers don’t always know about this, but the Scions look for Sleepers who might accept the truth (or something close to it). Sleepers willing to believe in a spirit world might be readier to believe in a Supernal World as well and want to regain their place in it.</div><div>Scions rarely approve of outright slavery for spirits. The Legacy’s traditions say that slavery is wrong no matter who is the master and who is the slave. Masquers allow permanent bindings, however, if all parties take them willingly. Thus, Scions may grant spirit familiars to other mages (or even mortals) or tether spirits to locations as their guardians and caretakers. The spirits always give informed consent — but the Scions’ second attainment can make a spirit agree to a permanent binding. As long as the commands did not involve the use of Intimidation, most Scions say they didn’t force the spirits’ wills: the Scions were just very persuasive, and the spirits responded to the Supernal righteousness of the Holy Guardian Angel. But that slippery slope easily leads to Hubris.</div><div>As the Scions of God gain power, they become frequent visitors to the spirit courts. Masquers often represent human interests to the spirits or serve as diplomats between spirit courts. As mortals (or former mortals), Scions have more flexible minds than the spirits, and the wiser spirit-lords value this quality. Bene Elohim often acquire spirits as Allies, Contacts and Mentors, not just familiars. Even if a Scion joins a court, however, the Masquer never pledges unconditional fealty to a spirit. The Scion serves as an allied but independent contractor or advisor, who can cancel his pact if he accepts the penalties agreed upon beforehand. Supernal creatures must not abase themselves to lower entities.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>The Scions of God accept applicants without regard to their Path. Applicants must be members of the Silver Ladder in good standing, though, and with no major scandals in their past. A would-be Masquer begins by asking an existing member to act as his sponsor to the Legacy’s master mages. Three senior Scions question the applicant and examine his past for crimes or dangerous entanglements with other groups, whether mortal or supernatural: the Bene Elohim do not want to grant their power to mages who might misuse the power in service to demons, the Exarchs or even fouler entities. Since an experienced Masquer collects many contacts in the spirit world, including spirits of knowledge and divination, the Legacy can perform quite a thorough background check. If the three examiners agree the applicant seems sincere and competent to follow the Legacy’s training, the applicant’s sponsor (or another Scion) can become the mage’s tutor.</div><div>A mage does not become a Scion quickly. First, a would-be Scion must build her oratory; she furnishes it with an altar, lamp and censer. The aspirant decorates the oratory to look like her vision of her Path’s Watchtower and remind her of her Holy Guardian Angel’s image. For instance, an Obrimos aspirant who sees her spiritual self as an angelic seraph (Hebrew for “Fiery Serpent”) would drape her oratory with scarlet silk embroidered with golden lightning-bolts and serpents, while a Moros who sees his Holy Guardian Angel as an Egyptian death-god such as Seker might make his oratory look like an Egyptian tomb. A door and windows open on a patio where the mage can receive spirits. Nearby is a spartan chamber for reading, eating and sleeping. The aspiring Scion studies folklore, occult texts and religious art to inspire her imagination about the form of her Holy Guardian Angel. Through long meditation, the applicant queries her own soul about the form her spiritual self should take. The initiation cannot begin until both aspirant and tutor are sure they know the Holy Guardian Angel’s appearance, and fashion the candidate’s ceremonial mask and costume.</div><div>The initiation lasts 40 days. The aspirant spends hours each day in her oratory, praying to the Highest in the name of her Holy Guardian Angel and imagining herself in the form shown by her mask and costume. The would-be Scion fasts during the day and eats sparingly in the evening.</div><div>Most importantly, the aspirant uses Spirit 2 “Peer Across the Gauntlet” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 247) every waking moment, first in his oratory and then out in the world. He must gain the habit of seeing the Shadow Realm as much a part of his surroundings as the material world, if not more so. That’s the view he’ll have once he gains his first attainment, so a Scion had better be sure he wants it. The Shadow Realm is not always pleasant to see.</div><div>The aspirant spends the last day alone with her tutor. She begins her prayer and meditation at dawn. At noon, she kneels at her altar. The tutor infuses her with a point of Mana as a sacrament before linking their souls. In this visionary experience, the aspirant sees her Holy Guardian Angel in the form she has decided, and steps within it. It is not a part of her; she is part of it. From then on, she is a Scion of God, an angel who walks the Fallen World. Afterward, her tutor presents the new Scion to her examiners, who confirm her in the Legacy.</div><div>Subsequent initiations to the second and third attainments also take place in a Scion’s oratory and require many hours of meditation, prayer and rituals to purify the Masquer and assert his identity with his Holy Guardian Angel. The rites themselves have no special requirements. The third attainment is a big event with the Legacy, however, and other Archangels — living and dead — often wait to honor the Scion and welcome him to their company.</div><div>Many Scions believe that death and transition to a fully spiritual existence form their Legacy’s fourth attainment. After a Scion’s corporeal death and cremation, other members of the Legacy gather to deconsecrate and dismantle her oratory. A place that has seen so much traffic between worlds leaves a weak spot in the Gauntlet that hostile spirits might use to invade the material world. Destroying the oratory solves these potential problems. </div><div>Everything intimately connected to the dead Scion must be destroyed as well. Such relics could fetter a deceased Masquer to the world, turning him into an insane ghost-mage instead of becoming a spirit noble or Ascending to the Supernal World. Destroying relics also prevents enemy mages from gaining power over former Scions.</div>",

        "firstAttainmentDescription": "<div>The first stage in becoming a spirit is learning to see the Shadow Realm all the time, unless the Masquer consciously chooses to ignore the local spirits. Angelic Sight resembles the Spirit 2 spell “Peer Across the Gauntlet,” except this attainment is on all the time, and the character sees spirits as a reflexive action. Spirit enables a Scion to see across the Gauntlet. Space extends this perception to normal viewing range and around merely material barriers — though the Scion only sees the spiritual environment on the other side. For example, a Scion might see the vegetation-spirit in a walled garden or the spite-demon haunting an especially unhappy home. That doesn’t mean the Scion sees the people in the home or can read bank statements in the owner’s safe: such things do not impinge on the Shadow Realm.</div><div>Material barriers impose a –1 die penalty to perceptions rolls, and a wall with an Awakened spirit blocks Angelic Sight completely. (Instead, the Scion sees the wall’s spirit jeering at her attempt to see through it.) The local Gauntlet strength can modify perceptions rolls, too. (See Mage: The Awakening, p. 282 for these modifiers.) </div>",

        "secondAttainmentDescription": "<div>As a Scion of God fuses his Supernal soul with his Holy Guardian Angel, he gains a divine authority over lesser spirits. He no longer needs spells to bend spirits to his will: he speaks, and they must obey — if they are not too powerful.</div><div>In many ways, this attainment is a generalized form of the Spirit 3 rote, “Crown of the Incarna” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 248). A Masquer, however, is not restricted to Presence + Intimidation + Spirit for his dice pool. He can use whatever Attribute + Ability pairing best suits his circumstances and personal aptitudes, just as dealing with people. An imperious command suits most spirits, especially when exorcising a hostile spirit from someone’s home. Now and then, though, a Scion may prefer a softer approach to play on a spirit’s personality quirks (Manipulation + Subterfuge), flatter the spirit (Manipulation + Persuasion) or even seduce the spirit (Presence + Socialize) before applying the Scion’s magical will. A spirit that doesn’t realize it was compelled to serve is a spirit that’s less likely to cause trouble later.</div><div>Similar to “Crown of the Incarna,” a Divine Command lasts only one scene. For each success, the Scion can impose one short command (or one element of a more complicated command). Once a Masquer achieves Spirit 4, he can use the Advanced Prolongation table (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 119) for a longer period of service, at cost of a penalty to his dice pool for compelling the target spirit.</div>",
        "secondAttainmentOptArcana": "Space 3",
        "secondAttainmentOptDescrizione": "<div>If a Scion has Space 3 and Spirit 4, she can command a spirit through a sufficiently strong sympathetic link such as a person the spirit influenced or an object used as a fetter. For instance, if a Masquer recognized that a demon recently influenced a person to commit some heinous act, the Scion could command the demon to appear through its link to its victim. The Storyteller decides the strength and duration of the sympathetic tie based on the extent and intimacy of the contact. For instance, a spirit’s current fetter has an Intimate connection, as would a mortal who mortgaged his soul to a demon. An abandoned fetter or a single use of a spirit’s power on a person creates a Known level of contact for a week, after which the connection degrades to Acquainted for the next month, before dropping to Encountered from then on. Repeated contact between a spirit and a mortal could strengthen the connection to Intimate, perhaps for a long time afterwards.</div><div>Some spirits may be called or influenced using special names or sigils. These are not sympathetic ties, however, so they do not convey the Divine Command. A Scion can use such names or sigils, but this becomes a spell, or an invocation of a power defined by the spirit itself, not an exercise of innate spiritual authority.</div>",
        "thirdAttainmentName": "Hand of the Elohim",
        "thirdAttainmentPrerequisites": "Gnosis 7, Spirit 4",
        "thirdAttainmentDescription": "<div>As a Scion of God merges with his Holy Guardian Angel, body and soul, he can reach into Twilight or through the Gauntlet by a mere act of will. He can send a hand across the Gauntlet, similar to the Spirit 3 spell “Reaching” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 250), or step across completely, similar to the Spirit 4 spell “Road Master” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 254). He may affect any spirit in Twilight or near him in the Shadow Realm, with any of his physical abilities because he exists in both worlds. Conversely, a Scion in the Shadow Realm could reach across the Gauntlet to affect people and objects in the physical world. Reaching into the other world does not require any sort of dice roll. Any particular action might, though, and can suffer a penalty for Gauntlet Strength. For example, if a Scion wanted to punch an elemental across a Strength 5 Gauntlet, the player would roll Strength + Brawling + Spirit – the spirit’s Defense, at a further –3 penalty for the Gauntlet’s Strength.</div><div>When a Scion uses Hand of the Elohim, whatever part of her that crosses into another zone of reality appears in the form the Scion imagines for her Holy Guardian Angel. For example, a Scion who imagines her spiritual self as a robed eagle-woman would manifest her hand with raptor’s talons in the Shadow Realm — or in the material world, if she stood on the other side of the Gauntlet. While in Twilight, she could manifest her entire spiritual form to those in the Fallen World, as if she were a materialized spirit. Since she uses an attainment rather than a spell, such a manifestation does not provoke Paradox (though the Sleeper might still Disbelieve afterward). Indeed, such a manifestation (especially when augmented with “Celestial Fire” — see below) may shock a Sleeper into belief in magic, becoming a Sleepwalker. On a few occasions, sight of a Scion’s angelic form actually sparked Awakenings.</div>",

They rode over the waves of the sea like the reflection of the moon on the water and flew through the night sky, free of their mortal weight.</div><div>The Sodality of the Tor understands the Mystery behind these beliefs and legends. The classical world saw the moon as a symbol of ecstatic Divinity, the Mystery and magic that dwelt in the night. The moon was otherworldly, but inextricably tied to the mortal experience. “Drawing down” the moon means not literally to pull the moon from the sky, but to draw the essence of the moon into oneself, so its light can reveal the latent divinity within the soul. Thus revealed, the Goddess Within manifests in the flesh of her witch and priestess.</div><div>This concept is the Sodality of the Tor’s most sacred Mystery, in which one of their number draws into herself a shard of the Eternal Divine. In this way, the Sodality understand those divine traits that reside within themselves, and foster them accordingly. Their rites shape a Sodality witch’s soul, making it more and more like that presence she communes with during these rites as she walks her path.</div><div>The witches of the Sodality teach that the human soul can embrace godhood only when the soul sets aside the conscious mind. They believe the Supernal is not transcendent, grandly beyond the human understanding; rather, it is immanent, found within all things wild and natural. Thus, by casting aside the reservations and fears of the conscious mind, and allowing the unconscious and primal side of the self free reign, the Awakened (and some gifted Sleepers) can touch the divine.</div><div>Mages outside of the Sodality sometimes believe its devotees give themselves over to possession. The truth is more subtle. A Sodality mage never actually loses consciousness during these rites, though her experience may be so overwhelming that she does not remember everything that happened. The witch who draws down Divinity is herself, but not — her essential self remains, but has expressed itself as a divine being, in the same way that her essential self is normally expressed as a human being.</div><div>Sodality witches usually find that their divine selves are very familiar to them from their own studies in world mythology, and these witches often take shadow names based on the god they see in the moon’s mirror. When one of these witches speaks of “drawing down Artemis” or “aspecting the Morrigan,” they mean letting the qualities attributed to those gods rise in their own personalities. They don’t let a god in; they let a god out.</div><div>The Sodality’s prime ceremony is the Rite of Drawing Down, held during full moons. Members of this Legacy may travel quite a distance to take part in this rite; traditionally, the elder who initiated a witch of the Sodality hosts these rituals, and all those she has trained will converge to take part in the ritual. However, the demands of Awakened life sometimes preclude this, and elders will usually welcome any member of the Sodality who is in the area. </div><div>Sleepwalkers sometimes attend these gatherings. Most of these people belong to a coven of the witchcult backed by the Sodality. Some members of the Legacy support or even lead covens of traditionalist witches, whose members lead lives that are not outwardly involved in occultism. Many members of the Sodality recruit members of such covens as Allies, Contacts and Sleepwalker Retainers. </div><div>Mages who know the Sodality only by reputation often believe the Legacy recruits only women, since classical and modern pagan thought treats its primary symbol as feminine. Other mages believe the men of the Sodality “draw down the Sun” in a fashion different from the Legacy’s women. </div><div>Neither of these misconceptions is true. Though Western occult systems call the moon a feminine symbol, witches (a term applied to both men and women) of the Sodality know that the moon is properly a symbol of ecstatic Divinity, a symbol under which the gods of all Dionysian expressions of religion gather. </div>",

Gods of crafts and skill, chaos and trickster-gods often find the Free Council amenable. Spiral Walkers with martial god-selves might join the Adamantine Arrow, just as those Spiral Walkers whose god-selves are divine royalty may find the Silver Ladder to their liking. </div>",
        "appearance": "In everyday life, members of the Sodality of the Tor rarely look as though they belong to a cult that conducts ecstatic dances under the full moon. In fact, many Spiral Walkers take great pains to avoid looking “odd,” preferring to wear simple, respectable clothing appropriate for their callings. Many do come to prefer the freedom of looser clothing, however. Fortunately, few corners of modern society now demand corsets, stranglingly tight collars or other restrictive clothing. The most sacred symbols of the Sodality are the circle, the moon and the spiral. Many of these witches wear bracelets, rings and necklaces of semiprecious stones (particularly stones of organic origin, such as amber or jet) that include these symbols.",
        "background": "Mages who join the Sodality come from all walks of life, though many of them already had ties to British witchcraft. Many in the Sodality belong to traditional witchcraft covens or even some of the old witchcraft families of England. Others of the Sodality are involved with English anthropology or archaeology. If they weren’t part of such groups before their Awakening, they may join them afterward.",
        "organizzation": "The Sodality operates in groups called covens. A coven usually consist of one or two Sodality mages leading several more un-Awakened members (usually reflected by the Sleepwalker Retainers Merit). The mage serves as the High Priest or High Priestess who performs the sacred rites and teaches the Sodality’s doctrine that magic expresses the inner divinity of human beings. However, magic is not Divinity itself: Sleepers can experience moments of godhood, too.<div>At the Legacy’s core, the base interaction among members of the Sodality is between the teacher and apprentice. This one-on-one training is the social foundation for interaction among the members of this Legacy — members are known by their initiators, and most members of the Sodality can quote their “lineages” back to the 1800s and beyond.</div><div>Most Sodality members belong to five major “branches,” based on the common initiators to whom members can be traced. These roughly correspond to geographical areas, but only as a matter of convenience rather than a strict rule: if a mage wants to join the Sodality, she probably chooses a tutor in her own area.</div><div><i>Ebudae:</i>This branch, one of the Sodality’s two oldest branches, began near the New Forest area in Britain. Made up of old witch families and their retainers, the Ebudae trace their lineage back to the 1400s by name, though they claim the Legacy has been around much longer. A matriarch of the Ebudae organized the Lammas Night Working. Additionally, most members of the Sodality in India and several other former British colonies come from this line.</div><div><i>Gretna:</i> This branch takes its name from the village where the branch began. It is at least as old as the Ebudae line. The Gretna occupy northern Britain and counts many Scottish witches among its initiates. Gretna witches have long-running rivalries with the Ebudae, and each branch likes to claim that the other sprang from it. Similar to the Ebudae, the Gretna can trace their lineages of initiation back to the 1400s.</div><div><i>Rochlaer:</i> The Rochlaer branch is confined primarily to Germany and the Netherlands. They are nearly as old as the Ebudae and Gretna, able to trace their initiation lineages back to the early 1500s. The Rochlaer have absorbed no small amount of Norse and Germanic customs into their ceremonies and ritual magic, including Norse seidhr (cauldron-scrying) and rune-cutting, and German hexencraft. Many Rochlaer join the Mysterium, which appreciates their skill at divination.</div><div><i>Orsanith:</i> The Orsanith branch is primarily American and, compare to the other branches of the Legacy. Orsanith was an American Thyrsus who met an Ebudeainitiated member of the Sodality during the Great War. The two of them hit it off, and Orsanith found himself fascinated by the Ebudea’s theology. They became lovers first, and then she initiated him into the Legacy. Orsanith returned to America in the 1920s, and the Legacy has spread since then. Most American Sodality come from the Orsanith branch, though Appalachia and New England has a few isolated Ebudae, Gretna and Rochlaer lineages that date back to colonial times.</div><div><i>Janiluth:</i> The Janiluth branch began in the 1940s, when a young witch of the Gretna line broke with her elders. She moved to Australia (some say she fled with some of the grimoires her initiator loaned her, and refused to return them) and established her own branch of the Legacy. Though Gretna initiates tend to be quite hostile to those of the Janiluth line, they are accepted (likely due to their welcome by the Ebudae, whom most other Sodality realize are simply doing so to spite the Gretna).</div><div>A cabal called the Avalonian Sisterhood tends the Glastonbury Tor on behalf of the Sodality as a whole. The Sisterhood traditionally includes at least one member of each branch. Other branches have appeared and disappeared over the centuries, as lines simply dwindle in number or crumble due to infighting.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>This Legacy is an old one, of that there can be no doubt. Members of the Sodality have in their possession a variety of grimoires, journals and other accounts that date back centuries, and at least two of the lines verifiably trace their origins back to the 1400s. That’s just when the Legacy began recording its history, though — before then, witchcraft was simply passed down from one Awakened to another. Quite possibly, this Legacy may be found nearly anywhere in the world, if only as a solitary practice between a mentor and her apprentice.</div><div>As an organization, however, the Sodality is very much a British phenomenon. Despite spreading around the world in recent centuries, the Sodality retains a distinctly British flavor to many of its techniques, and is strongest where the British have settled. Sodality legend claims that the first witches who practiced their Legacy’s techniques came to Britain in the long-ago days of the Roman Empire. Indeed, according to the folklorists of the Legacy, the Sodality’s origins lie with the coming of Joseph of Arimathea and the planting of the Thorn of Glastonbury.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Thorn of Glastonbury</h3><div>According to popular British legend, Joseph of Arimathea was a merchant who knew Christ. Joseph came to Britain after the Crucifixion, bearing the Holy Grail, said to be filled with the blood of Christ gathered while He hung on the cross. As Joseph lay down to rest on Glastonbury Tor, he pushed his staff, a piece of wood cut from a thorne tree, into the earth beside him. When he awoke, the staff had sprouted roots and branches. Taking this as a sign, he placed the Grail within the Chalice Well, which to this day has reddish-tinted waters.</div><div>The usually-pagan members of the Sodality add little to this story, save to mention that one of Joseph of Arimathea’s associates, a middle-aged woman named Thana, also decided to remain at the Tor. Thana was a Roman witch who claimed to have inherited old Etruscan witchcraft, passed down among peasants long after the Etruscan culture had been assimilated into that of Rome.</div><div>The Sodality claims that Thana found many of the native Awakened here, and found that their ways were similar; so much so, she initiated them into the techniques that became the foundation for the Sodality of the Tor.</div><div>The Sodality teaches that its early days were spent in quiet growth, as the witches of the Tor sought out their sisters in the hidden vales and hills of the British Isles. Many witches chose not to embrace the Sodality’s teachings, but some did, and the Sodality grew.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>A Time of Hysteria</h3></div><div>According to the legends of the Sodality, the witch-craze times almost never touched the Spiral Walkers. Most Awakened are more than capable of escaping Sleeper notice, and, failing that, Awakened are more than capable of escaping imprisonment and torture. Most importantly, however, the witch-hunters targeted people with traits that the Sodality did not possess: all too often, solitary widows with a bit of land and no one to defend them.</div><div>In contrast, the families of the Sodality were large and sprawling by this era, with small witch families arrayed around initiated Spiral Walkers, ready to help them whenever there was need. As a result, the Sodality was forced to simply watch as many innocents were killed for their property. The people of these times saw tremendous change around them — political and social reform, plague and war — and they panicked, seeking a source of these changes that they could attack or control. So, they blamed “witches” for their fears, and tried to find those witches and kill them.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The First Witch War</h3></div><div>In the late 1400s, members of the Ebudae and Gretna lines began squabbling, each claiming that the other had performed some great wrong. The precise details of what happened vary with each teller —grimoires and artifacts certainly disappeared from both sides and accusations of theft flew fast and thick. The harsh feelings on both sides grew until there weren’t simply words being exchanged, but curses.</div><div>By the start of the 1500s, war raged among the Sodality witches of Britain, and several of these conflicts drew in other Awakened. By the time the Awakened of Britain understood that this was more than a simple feud among some individual witches, the conflict was already out of control. Though the Consilii eventually stopped the conflict, many mages had already died.</div><div>Many Spiral Walkers refused to take sides and fled what they considered a fool’s war. These witches emigrated and formed the Rochlaer line in continental Europe. To this day, some Rochlaer regard the Ebudae and Gretna lines as hot-heads more concerned with their own pride than performing the Legacy’s sacred duties.</div><div>Among the other Awakened, the Sodality’s name became associated with bickering, selfish mages for quite a few decades after this witch war. The shamefaced Sodality slunk out of sight and kept a low profile for centuries.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Lammas Night Working</h3><div>It wasn’t until World War II that the Sodality emerged once again into the eyes of Britain’s Consilii. This time, London was in the middle of the Blitz and it looked like Hitler would invade. Ebudae leaders sent out a call to the other lines, and the Sodality answered. Members of all of the European lines gathered on the cliffs overlooking the Channel between Britain and France, on the other side of which the Nazi forces gathered. </div><div>On Lammas Night, the covens gathered in force. Not only Sodality were present — many other Awakened witches arrived as well, with witch family members and Sleepwalker members of covens to lend their aid. A great Working was performed, an act of magic so taxing that several older witches died from exhaustion and Pattern Scourging as they wove a great spell to defend their beloved Albion from invasion. Shortly after the Working, Hitler changed his mind and invaded the Soviet Union instead. Britain’s mages still don’t know if the Lammas Night Working was responsible: Nazi leaders made plenty of crazy decisions all by themselves. </div><div>The Sodality’s elders and a few other mages know the Working was really aimed at members of their own Legacy who’d fallen in with the Nazi party. Even Sleeper historians know about the Nazi leaders’ occult obsessions. The Guardians of the Veil decided the Nazis’ allies in the Spiral Walkers shouldn’t have a chance to tell Hitler’s henchmen any more about the real supernatural, and pressured the Legacy’s leaders to deal with the situation. To this day, the British lines still watch the Rochlaer carefully, though the German Sodality claims it expunged all such elements from their lineage.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Some mages despise the Sodality as wild men and women who give themselves over to possession, while other mages respect the natural, primal wisdom the Sodality discover within. Many of the Obrimos are fascinated by the Sodality’s ideas of inner divinity, though also frightened by that loss of control.</div><div>Many older or historically-minded mages consider the Sodality quarrelsome and prone to old, ridiculous rivalries and lineage-grudges more appropriate to Sleeper occultists than to the truly Awakened. Indeed, these mages question the “inner divinity” of the Spiral Walkers. Surely, if they were tapping into godhood, wouldn’t they at least act a bit more wise and dignified in their dealings?</div><div>In reply, the Sodality reminds their fellow Awakened that the old pagan gods were always rivals, competing and back-stabbing one another. Why should the witches who embody these old gods act any differently?</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Tor</h3><div>Though the Sodality takes its practices and theology from a blend of classical and Celtic concepts, the Legacy’s name comes from an English site: the Glastonbury Tor. Believed by some to be the location of the mythic Avalon of Arthurian legendry, the Tor is an impressive, steep hill, set with a sevenfold spiral path.</div><div>Sodality mages point out that, when viewed from above, the Glastonbury spiral path resembles patterns found elsewhere: for instance, the Cretan spiral found on many Mediterranean coins and believed to have some ties to the labyrinth of legend. The pattern also appears on a seventh-century bc Etruscan vase, a pillar in Pompeii and the “Mother Earth” symbol of the Arizona Hopi.</div><div>Furthermore, the spiral divides the hill into seven tiers — like the Mem of Hindu mythology (the seven-leveled mountain where dwell the gods) and the seven-tiered Babylonian ziggurat. Awakened loremasters say Glastonbury Tor falls squarely within traditions and symbolic forms spread around the world by the Atlantean diaspora.</div><div>The Tor itself holds a very potent Hallow; its tass accumulates in the Chalice Well. Of course, the Avalonian Sisterhood collects the Mana-charged water every night at midnight, so the token phials of water that most visitors to the Tor take away are simply vials of well water.</div><div>The Awakened of the Tor have approached the problem of how to prevent the gradual weakening of the Tor’s Hallow in a unique way: rather than allow it to simply become a sight-seeing location, and risk the irreverence that has vitiated other sites (notably Stonehenge), the Sodality encourage all visitors, regardless of their faith, to see the Tor as a sacred site.</div><div>Glastonbury proper holds a number of churches, seated next to New Age and occult shops. The tours offered all emphasize the overall sacredness of the site, rather than focusing on any one religion’s idea. Meditation walks are led up the Tor itself, with requests that participants remain silent and thoughtful on the trip up the Tor, and all of the tour guides discuss the syncretic expressions of sacredness that the Tor has held through the centuries.</div><div>Numerous Sodality members live and work nearby. In fact, mages who want to join the Sodality are usually told to come here: if one mage meets another Awakened at the Glastonbury Tor, she is probably a Spiral Walker or a seeker after membership.</div><div>At the top of the Tor proper stands St. Michael’s Tower. This impressive tower once served to magically contain the power of the Glastonbury Tor Hallow, but does so no longer. The tower was named for the Archangel known as a great dragonslayer. In Britain, lines of natural, earthly power are called “dragons” — so the tower itself served as a “dragonslayer,” containing this energy.</div><div>In the early 1960s, the Sodality’s elders decided that it simply wasn’t practical to tap the Hallow in the Tor’s most visible tourist attraction. The Sodality’s elders dismantled the restraining magics of the tower so the Hallow’s energy would circulate through the entire Tor. The Hallow’s power became less secure from other mages — but a lot more secure from Sleeper intrusion. Since then, many people have reported seeing strange lights and bobbing balls of energy spiraling up the Tor at night. Many visitors also claim to have seen the interior of St. Michael’s Tower illuminated by a strange white light with no discernable source.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Witch Families</h3></div><div>In places where the Sodality has existed for multiple generations, there are bound to be witch families. Most such families are made up of Sleepwalkers, and they produce more than a few Proximi, as well. These families have no single defining trait, other than their blood relation to a witch of the Sodality and their share in the secrets of that witch.</div><div>Children growing up in these witch families see all manner of strange things that their parents urge them not to talk about. Because of this early and frequent exposure to frankly supernatural events, most of these children grow into Sleepwalkers. The witch families of the Sodality usually have excellent fortune and health, thanks to the magic of their family members.</div><div>Spiral Walkers do not perceive these families as servants or retainers. They are simply one’s relations, all of whom share in a great secret. Just because a member of the family Awakens doesn’t mean that the family member is somehow greater than she used to be — in fact, by the family’s standards, she now simply has more responsibility.</div><div>Mages who join the Sodality are often encouraged to marry into the family of their tutors, or are flatout adopted into the families (at least informally). A Sodality witch’s tutor is often considered a parent, so that one’s mentor’s siblings become one’s aunts and uncles, their parents become one’s grandparents, and so on. The Sodality stands only on family titles — the Spiral Walkers need nothing else.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>The Sodality of the Tor does not, as an organization, select who receives initiation into their Legacy. Instead, individual Spiral Walkers simply decide to take on apprentices they consider worthy. Of course, applicant mages need some essential understandings, and some must be trained in the techniques of European witchcraft (as reflected in the Skill requirements in the first attainment).</div><div>No one else can gainsay a Spiral Walker’s choice in pupils, for the Sodality prizes autonomy. In this fashion, the Spiral Walkers consider themselves a family: a grandmother does not tell her daughter whether or not to have a child. (At least, not in a well-adjusted family.) The best a grandmother can do is try to rectify any mistakes in upbringing that her daughter may make with her child.</div><div>The initiations of the Sodality are neither physically rigorous, such as those of the Perfected Adepts, nor psychologically traumatic, such as those of the Clavicularius. However, the Sodality’s initiations are certainly transformative, for, at their apex, they involve a literal meeting with the Awakened’s godself, a glimpse of the mage as a Supernal being.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The First Initiation</h3></div><div>The first initiation takes place within a spiral labyrinth. Preferably, this happens at the Glastonbury Tor proper, but this is not always feasible. Many Sodality witches with ample sanctum space build rose-hedge labyrinths or full stone ones somewhere in their area. Other Spiral Walkers simply construct labyrinths from bales of hay or stones laid out in a footpath. All that is necessary is the walking of that pattern.</div><div>The initiation always takes place at night, and occurs naked, after the applicant drinks a mildly hallucinogenic elixir prepared by steeping certain herbs in hot, spiced wine. The dedicant begins dancing the spiral when the moon rides high in the sky, as her tutor begins a chant in Atlantean, invoking the Supernal self of her new apprentice.</div><div>When the apprentice reaches the center of the spiral, she kneels before a steaming cauldron filled with more of the herb-infused wine. The apprentice gazes into the cauldron, catching sight of the moon’s reflection in the brew, and then takes up the chalice that is her Path tool. She scoops some of the brew from the middle of the moon’s reflection, symbolically capturing the moon itself in her cup, and then downs the mixture.</div><div>The hallucinations intensify then. The tutor watches carefully to make sure the student hasn’t inadvertently poisoned herself with an overdose — but the experience must be allowed to take its toll. Most Sodality witches know the precise mixture of herbs to allow their apprentices to walk that razor’s line between an ineffective brew and a poisonous concoction. The tutor shapes the pupil’s soul as the pupil engages in a vision-quest for her divine self.</div><div>When the apprentice emerges from her inner journey, she has met her god-self, learned its secret name and communed with it. Then, the witch helps her apprentice to her feet and guides her through her first Drawing Down the Moon ritual, helping the apprentice make manifest what she has already encountered within.</div><div>Once the Supernal self manifests itself within the apprentice, the tutor bows low before this Divinity and introduces herself and asks for any advice the god-self may have in teaching the new witch. Mentors always listen carefully to this advice, for the purpose of initiation into this Legacy is the manifestation of the Supernal self — and none know how to better achieve this than the inner god itself.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Subsequent Initiations</h3><div>The second and third initiations are called “elevations,” indicating that once the first initiation has occurred, subsequent ones simply build upon the first, rather than imparting something new.</div><div>The second initiation takes place within the center of the spiral, where the process is repeated. The mentor simply watches over the Drawing Down in this instance, and, once it occurs, speaks an invocation of that godself, drawing it further out. Many Sodality witches show their first physical manifestations at this time, and are often sore afterwards. This ritual takes place entirely in the center of the spiral, over the cauldron.</div><div>Like the second, the third initiation begins in the center of the spiral. Again, the Drawing Down occurs, and the tutor invokes the god-self with an Atlantean invocations that unlock the third attainment. Then, the god-self, in complete control of the apprentice’s body, walks the spiral in reverse, moving from the center of the spiral to the outer.</div><div>The spiral in these initiations symbolizes the inner journey toward Divinity. The first initiation has the apprentice walking into the spiral, seeking out the center of the Supernal self. The second initiation has the apprentice dwelling in the center of the spiral, and the third has the journey of the god-self to the outside of the spiral, representing the manifestation of the inner divinity into the outer world.</div>",

        "attainmentsDescrizione": "<div>Spiral Walkers do not use their attainments lightly. In fact, most Sodality members prefer to use them in ritual context, during the gatherings of their covens during the full moon. That said, the witches of the Sodality understand that these abilities come with the manifestation of Divinity, and so are their birthright.<div>Each Sodality attainment is performed by the process of “drawing down the Moon.” This is not the near-possession of some ecstatic practices, such as the process of “being ridden” by the loa, in voudoun practice. Rather, the Sodality witch attunes herself to her god-self, stripping away those aspects of the ego that prevent the expression and manifestation of her inner divinity. To many, drawing down the Moon feels like a presence outside of the self, but that is because the process strips away the mortal ego – it feels like surrendering oneself to something else, but it is simply the sublimation of the mortal self to allow the god-self to manifest.</div><div>In game terms, this does not cause the mage to be played as an NPC. The player, however, should make a point of playing her character differently, with a more archetypal bent. The player of the Sodality character should come up with some traits that help to define this manifestation — the eyes of those who draw down usually change color and a scent surrounds them suddenly. They may also change the way they speak and there may be other, minor physical changes, such as a slight difference in the voice or in the hue of the hair. These are not strange things that Sleepers recognize as supernatural, but are rather things that those who know the character would recognize as signs of the drawing down.</div>",

        "descrizione": "<div>One of the most elementary lessons in a mage’s study of the occult is that names have power. Mages take shadow names for this very reason, so that others cannot harm them with sympathetic magic — but what is a name, truly, and what defines the name of a thing? At what point does the name “Jane Smith” cease to define the witch who calls herself Branwen Boudicca? The Stone Scribes believe that a person’s name changes and grows subtly throughout his existence. Only at death, the cessation of existence, is a person’s true name fixed. The Stone Scribes call this the Final Name, and it is more than merely an identifying label that eases the working of sympathetic spells. A person’s Final Name is an echo of that person’s soul, a sublime expression of the sum total of the fate that guided the life of the name’s owner. The Stone Scribes believe that only by knowing a person’s Final Name can you truly know the person — it is the ultimate record of who that person was, stripped of all layers of deceit and subterfuge.</div><div>First and foremost, the Stone Scribes are recordkeepers. The Scribes treat the collection of as many Final Names as possible as a sacred mission. Members of this Legacy lurk in hospitals, nursing homes and battlefields, places where many Final Names are set each day. The Scribes record these names using Arcane formulae and methods little-known to other mages, usually on the large stone tablets that earned the Legacy its name.</div><div>Unlike many in the Mysterium, the Stone Scribes do not merely acquire knowledge for its own sake. They collect, store and meticulously cross-reference as many Final Names as they can acquire, because their founder charged them with a sacred duty he said came from God Himself. By tracing the myriad threads of sympathetic connection back through multiple Final Names, the Namers believe they can reconstruct the Final Names of the long-deceased, up to and including the ancient lords of Atlantis. By learning those millennia-dead Names, the Scribes  claim they will be able to conjure up the shades of their distant ancestors and gain firsthand knowledge of the height of Atlantis — and direct tutelage in potent, forgotten Atlantean magic.</div><div>Not all Scribes are simple record-keepers, though. When a Namer falls to Hubris, she sometimes grows impatient waiting for death to come at its own pace, and decides to take her victims’ names at the times and places of her choosing. These so called Name Takers are assassins and killers, ritually murdering people whose names they desire and stealing their names at the moment of death. The Namers despise these apostates and accuse them of stealing souls along with Final Names, not to mention other left-handed practices — but even as the Scribes hate the Name Takers, Stone Scribes fear how easily they might slip down that path.</div>",

Modern-minded Namers sometimes join the Free Council and scribe Final Names with power tools and precision stonecutters. Few Scribes join the Silver Ladder or the Guardians of the Veil, since the Legacy cares more about collecting and studying Final Names than temporal power or keeping the secrets of the Mysteries from the Sleepers. Most Name Takers are apostates, though troubling rumors hint that Guardians of the Veil call upon Name Takers to track the repercussions of breaches of secrecy through the sympathetic ties of a Sleeper’s Final Name.",
        "appearance": "Most Namers dress in a manner appropriate to their jobs (or whatever they use as a reason to come into contact with the dying), though they tend toward the conservative side of fashion. Nurses usually wear simple, solid-colored scrubs rather than bright, festively-patterned ones, battlefield journalists wear the fatigues of the unit they are embedded with and so on. The recording of Final Names is a solemn duty, and the Scribes dress soberly to show respect for their job.",
        "background": "Many Stone Scribes were touched by the loss of death at some point in their lives. Some lost a parent, friend or loved one, while others had their own near-death experiences. Sometimes, this event led to the mage’s Awakening. Other times, death was merely a powerful event that stayed with the mage for the rest of her life. Whatever the nature of the death, what affects the mage who seeks to become a Namer in Stone is often the senseless loss of the decedent’s knowledge and life experiences. While Final Names do not hold personal histories of their owners, at least they are tangible relics of the deceased.",
        "organizzation": "Almost all of the Stone Scribes belong to the Mysterium, and thus they simply fall into the Mysterium’s hierarchy. When groups of Scribes come together to form a Bibliotheca (“Library”), they assign rank based on seniority. The most experienced Namer (not necessarily the one with highest Gnosis or Arcana ratings), called the Philologus, directs all those underneath him. They in turn have authority over those with less experience than themselves. A Namer can only gainsay a superior if two-thirds of his own inferiors also oppose the superior. Apprentices are special cases in Bibliothecae: although apprentices are the lowest-ranked members, they are considered to speak with the voices of their tutors. In other words, if an apprentice says, “My tutor feels that this is a poor course of action,” the rest of the Bibliotheca treat that statement as having come from the tutor’s mouth. Apprentices seldom abuse this privilege more than once, and wise apprentices, never. In a similar vein, each tutor is considered the absolute authority when it comes to her own apprentices’ training. Even the Philologus cannot countermand an instruction given from a tutor to his apprentice.<div>Depending upon the local presence of the Stone Scribes and the preferences of the individual mages, a Bibliotheca might also be a cabal or the Scribes might belong to their own individual cabals and come together only to discuss matters related to the Legacy’s business. If the Mysterium is strong in the region, the Bibliotheca is often an adjunct to the local Athenaeum, with the Philologus serving as a deputy Curator over the library of scrivened Final Names. If the Mysterium has little presence, the Bibliotheca might serve as sole custodian of the local Athenaeum, with the Philologus pulling double-duty as Curator.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2></div><div>During the Golden Age of Atlantis, the Stone Scribes say, there was no need for their Legacy. When people passed on, their souls ascended to the Supernal World and dwelled for a time in the realm of Stygia before returning to the lower world, their memories gone but the sum of their countless lives still bound up in the resonance of their Names. The forefathers of the Stone Scribes were not archivists but seers who could follow the winding paths of their own Names or the Names of others to gain forgotten wisdom from past lives. These Name Walkers were among the mages who first explored and studied the Astral Realms, reaching deep into the Temenos and the Dreamtime.</div><div>After the Fall, the cosmology of the world changed drastically. No longer did the souls of the departed return from Stygia; they either lingered as ghosts, or vanished beyond the ken of the Awakened. The onetime Name Walkers found themselves obsessed with this new concept of a permanent death, and that obsession drew them to the Watchtower of the Lead Coin. The new generations of Necromancers searched for a way to preserve Names lost to the vagaries of the Abyss. Their early attempts involved harvesting souls — which led to madness and horror, and to a bitter wizards’ war amongst the sect.</div><div>Little is now known of the Soul War. The victors destroyed the names of the soul-takers, so that no later mage could call up their shades.</div><div>In the aftermath of the Soul War, a cabal of Moros mages whom legend calls the Unnamed Pentacle, studying Name Walker texts that were already ancient, learned once more how to follow the winding threads of resonance that surrounded all sentient beings to their sources. To preserve at least some remnant of the dying, the Unnamed Pentacle studied the Arcana of Death and Fate. Eventually, these mages discovered a spell to transcribe an individual’s name at the moment of death, preserving an echo of the person’s soul for future generations. Because these mages scribed the Final Names they collected into stone monoliths erected in the image of the Watchtowers, or on large stelae, they earned the appellation Stone Scribes. </div><div>The early Stone Scribes perfected their art in ancient Egypt. The Namers say their monoliths inspired the Egyptians to erect obelisks. The cartouche, an oval carved or drawn around an Egyptian’s name, imitates the stelae on which the Scribes also recorded names. Like the Scribes, the Egyptians believed the name carried the essence of the self: as long as the name endured, so did the soul. </div><div>For millennia, the Stone Scribes were a tiny, looselyaffiliated society within the Mysterium. They became a Legacy in the 13th century. Arnobius, a Coptic monk and Namer in Stone, received what he referred to as a “sublime revelation from the Lord” while attending the funeral of his abbot. The Awakened monk spent months sequestered in the tombs of his abbey, meditating on ancient names of power and casting gematria while illuminated only by the wan flickering of corpse-candles. According to Namer tradition, God (or some other higher being) revealed to Arnobius the means to reconstruct the Name of one long-dead by following the sympathetic connections back from other Final Names.</div><div>Arnobius emerged from the catacombs a changed man: where once he had been of rotund stature and pleasant disposition, he emerged a gaunt specter of a man who wore an aura of quiet solemnity like a cloak. He left the monastery and began traveling across North Africa, Palestine, Syria and Europe, preaching his new Legacy to any Consilium that would have him. Wherever the Namers had established a Bibliotheca, Arnobius found ready converts. Within 20 years, almost the entire sect in Europe and the Near East was subsumed into the Legacy. The Stone Scribes as a sect of allied mages continued in other parts of the world, notably India and China, but in the past few centuries even those branches have joined the Legacy. Mysterium archeologists say that Stone Scribes practiced their art in pre–Columbian Mexico and Peru, but these longsundered, parallel lineages were lost in the European conquests and destruction of native kingdoms.</div><div>Arnobius continued to guide the Stone Scribes as “Philologus Primus” for decades, personally establishing most of the Legacy’s traditions and practice. The Scribes stopped carving Final Names on obelisks, crypts and other large monuments in favor of stone tablets. Arnobius used his clout within the Coptic Church to have Namers appointed abbots of many monasteries known for their large libraries, and instituted a standardized method of cataloging libraries of Final Names. Namers in Stone also obtained positions of authority in many Roman Catholic monasteries.</div><div>The centuries since Arnobius’ disappearance have seen a slow but steady decline of the Stone Scribes. Their connections in the Church faded as too few Philologi were willing to play politics and were ousted in favor of more popular (Sleeper) abbots, and the Bibliothecae had to scramble to find new homes. Universities became popular bases of operation for some Scribes, while others chose to hide in plain sight, setting up shop as stelographers (tombstone makers), carving Final Names into the headstones of their owners’ graves.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Most mages think the Stone Scribes is a harmless clique of scholars devoted to a curious and obscure magical practice. No mage would deny that names have power, of course, but even most Mysterium willworkers think there are better ways to learn about the past than writing names on rocks. The Stone Scribes allow this perception to continue — if other mages even thought the Namers had access, or were even close to attaining access to the secret knowledge of the Atlantean kings, the Legacy would come under siege. Scholars desperate for knowledge of magic’s Golden Age would mob Bibliothecae seeking audiences with ancient ghosts, while mages fearful of the power the Scribes might gain from the dead would come with knives in the dark.</div><div>Outside the Mysterium, few mages even know that the Namers exist — not out of any deliberate attempt at secrecy on the part of the Stone Scribes, but simply because most Legacy members are content to perform their self-appointed duty without drawing attention to themselves. When members of the other orders do notice the Scribes, it is often thanks to the crimes of a rogue Name-Taker. Consequently, the Stone Scribes sometimes have a poor reputation outside the Mysterium.</div><div>The Scribes’ culture is largely built around respect for the dead and the belief that all souls should leave a record of their passing. This respect often manifests as an intense curiosity about the lives of people whose Final Names they record. Some Namers interview friends or family members of the recently deceased to gain a more complete picture of their lives, while others go back further and study what life was like 50, 100 or even 1,000 years ago or more. Some Namers even go so far as to adopt such a lifestyle, either for a short time or permanently, but these anachronisms are considered eccentric even by other Scribes.</div><div>As befits a Legacy whose reason for existence is the recording of Final Names, labels and names form a major part of the Scribes’ lives. Most Stone Scribes have at least four names themselves: their birth name, the shadow name they adopted upon Awakening, a name given to them by their tutor upon being accepted as a pupil and used among other Namers and, finally, a private name given by their tutors and only used between tutor and apprentice. A Stone Scribe who takes an apprentice has a fifth name, privately given to the Scribe by his apprentice. These tutor/apprentice secret names are rarely complimentary, but are usually given in the spirit of familial ribbing rather than outright spite.</div><div>The Namers’ magic is built around the study of names, labels and descriptors of all sorts, all to trace the proverbial branches back to the roots of Awakened society. Names may be transitory until death, but even the knowledge of a person’s Momentary Name can prove useful. Namers employ a variety of magical practices involving names, but gematria is one of the most popular. Protective amulets inscribed with repeating patterns of names of power, and the Solomonic practices of summoning spirits using the manifold names of God are also common Scribe praxes.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Induction into the Stone Scribes is generally a straightforward and civilized process. The prospective Namer simply approaches a more experienced member of the Legacy, usually one she knows personally, and asks for instruction in the arts of the Scribes. Candidates are accepted as probationary members of the local Bibliotheca (if there is one) and typically set on mundane tasks for anywhere from one to three months. Tasks performed during this time include cataloging archives of Final Names, maintaining the Bibliotheca’s sanctum and, of course, a great deal of studying. Apprentices striving for the first attainment study the magic of names, including gematria, the names of the Angels of the Hours and the planets and various forms of animistic spirit-naming. As the applicant approaches readiness for the first attainment, she learns the spells used to scribe Final Names and preserve them forever. Later in her training, the candidate joins her tutor on his rounds and scribes several Final Names through the use of spells. The apprentice learns about the mystical importance of Final Names, and how they can fade with time if not set down in stone.</div><div>An apprentice also learns the history and legendry of the Legacy itself, from its founding as a sect of the Alae Draconis in Atlantis to its metamorphosis into the Stone Scribes after the Fall. She is expected to learn by heart the minutiae of Arnobius’ life and the rise of the Stone Scribes as a Legacy, and its gradual decline. An apprentice must research the stories of as many as 10 notable Scribes.</div><div>Once a mage proves she can reliably scribe a Final Name, her tutor guides her in crafting her soul. Only then does a tutor impart the Legacy’s techniques for finding the Final Names of the long dead, coaxing them back into full strength so that they may be recorded for future generations. Tutors do not impart the second attainment until a pupil shows her mastery of this technique.</div><div>The third stage of a Scribe’s formal training is usually the most active in her life. She has finished the long hours studying history and occult theory, but is not yet expected to settle down and start a Bibliotheca. A Scribe’s final period of tutelage usually finds her traveling and using the attainments of her Legacy to recover old, unrecorded Final Names. Some Scribes focus on recovering the Final Names of notable Sleepers, but the Legacy places special emphasis on the Final Names of ancient mages. At the last, journeyman Scribes learn to shape their own Momentary Names to match recorded Final Names, allowing the Scribes to sense the sympathetic ties of the mages of old — ties that sometimes lead to powerful mystic relics or storehouses of occult lore. Once a Scribe masters this magic, the journeyman is considered ready for the third attainment (Gnosis permitting). Only after gaining the third attainment does a Scribe learn the Legacy’s long-term goal to reach the ghosts of Atlantis.</div><div>Upon achieving the third attainment in their Legacy, most Scribes settle down, establish a Bibliotheca and devote themselves to the continued recording of Final Names and training their own apprentices. Some Scribes seek to follow in Arnobius’ footsteps and pursue the mythical fourth attainment and Ascension, while others forego the sedentary life and continue to travel and gather Final Names well into their elder years.</div>",
        "magic": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Final Names and Other Magic</h2><div>Once a mage records a Final Name, she or other mages can use it for other magic. The Stone Scribes’ chief interest lies in using Final Names to gain information from the past: a Final Name provides a Known connection to its subject (the same applies to a Momentary Name, while it lasts). So, if a mage wanted to view the life of a long-dead person using Time 2 “Postcognition” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 260), she would have a Known connection for targeting the spell. A Final Name is just about the best link possible, short of possessing the person’s actual cadaver, for summoning the dead from the Underworld.</div><div>A mage can also use the ties of Fate recorded in the Final Name to affect other people. In this case, however, each sympathetic tie is downgraded one step, compared to having the actual person on hand. Thus, a wife would be Intimately connected to a husband, but only Known to the husband’s recorded Final Name. Extra successes reduce this penalty, but can never raise the “virtual sympathy” above Known (–4 penalty). Naturally, the mage cannot use this information without access to other Arcana. Not knowing a target’s actual name also imposes the usual penalty, which cannot be countered by any number of successes at reading a Final Name.</div><div><b>Example:</b> <i>Dahlia studies the Final Name of one Frank Jefferson and her player achieves one success on Dahlia’s spellcasting roll. She learns that Jefferson has a daughter (Intimate connection). If Dahlia wanted to cast a spell on the daughter, Dahlia’s connection goes from Known (one step down from Intimate) to Encountered (because Dahlia doesn’t know the daughter’s name).</i></div><div><i>Dahlia tries again and, with three successes, and finds that Jefferson had an employee he once fired. This starts as an Acquainted person. If Dahlia wanted to cast a spell on the employee, her connection goes from Acquainted to Encountered for working from a Final Name, but bumps up to Known for the two extra successes; but then drops back to Acquainted for not knowing the employee’s name, for a net penalty of –6.</i></div>",

Traditionally, the Scribe carves the Final Name into a stone tablet at the moment of death, using Atlantean runes to cement the name’s nature for all time. As long as the name is written on some sort of permanent medium, however, and the proper reverence is given, a variety of alternative techniques are permissible. Some Scribes etch Final Names into buildings or monuments, and a rare few tattoo the names on their own skin, then have their skin made into parchment after death. Namers in the Free Council experiment with scribing Final Names in digital media so they can be transmitted by phone or over the Internet.</div><div>This attainment enables the Stone Scribes to perform their sacred duty, so they employ Memoriam almost constantly. Whenever a Scribe has the opportunity (or engineers one), he is expected to record the Final Names of anyone who dies in his presence.</div><div>This attainment allows the mage to use the Fate •• “Scribe Final Name” spell (see above), allowing him to capture and record a Final Name.

Unorthodox Scribes sometimes devise their own variants, but traditionalists of the Legacy look askance at such members. In the standard ritual, the Namer strips naked and paints his entire body with Atlantean runes representing the Final Name he wishes to assume.

XX). For example, if the Namer rolls two successes when using this attainment on a ghost whose anchors are a school, a baseball diamond and a girl, the Namer could change the school anchor to a dog and the girl anchor to an office building, but he could not add the office building and the dog as additional anchors, or remove the school and the girl without replacing them.

In their relentless pursuit of what they perceived to be universal truth, they plunged into the deepest conundrum of all — the inner workings of the most elementary particles of matter — and thereby inadvertently stumbled across the border that separates the Lie from magical reality.</div><div>Quantum physics, founded in the scientific crucible of rigorous observation and strict adherence to mathematic principle, seemed to demonstrate that the impossible was not only possible but happened everywhere all the time — merely on scales too tiny and in durations too brief for humans to notice. The basic building blocks of the world twinkled in and out of existence, no more substantial than the play of lights inside the eyelid. Solid reality was reduced to the breaking crest of a wave of probability. Information was seen to leap vast distances instantaneously, borne by mysterious mathematical entanglements. An array of alternate universes, each differentiated from its neighbor by a single iota, crowded in upon the stable material world. And, perhaps most detrimental to scientific objectivity, the slightest scrutiny suddenly acquired the amazing power to alter the factual content of observation.</div><div>This direct assault upon the detached objectivity of science reduced the academic world to what might aptly be described as pandemonium. Even Albert Einstein admitted the efficacy of quantum equations while confessing that he found their implications deeply unsettling. Interpretations of the new theory were propounded to resolve this philosophical crisis, but each seemed to involve greater metaphysical issues that provoked even more outrage. Many scientists refused to accept the broader implications of quantum theory, even though its predictive power produced such technological breakthroughs as television. Other physicists plunged headfirst into the madness — and, of those, a few found enlightenment.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Virtual Entities</h3><div>Being less than 100 years old, this Legacy can lay little claim to any mythic or legendary roots in Atlantis. That has not stopped the Threnodists from trying, however. Over the past two decades, an electronic facsimile of an “ancient manuscript” (dismissed as a fake by most arcane loremasters) has circulated among members of the Mysterium. Chinese, Tibetan and Sanskrit commentary surrounds what purports to be an “Agarthan” copy of an eons-old text written in a tiny delicate script averred by one commentator to be “a Floresian dialect of Lemurian.”</div><div>The text relates the adventures and conversations of one “Kwong Du,” the last of a race of diminutive hominids whose seafaring culture spanned the Indian and Pacific Oceans hundreds of thousands of years before the evolution of homo sapiens. This pre–Atlantean “Doubting Thomas” incurred disfavor by perpetually questioning everyone’s methods and approaches. Insisting that in magic, factual accuracy and clear logic are just as important as Supernal revelation, this puckish smartass is depicted as prehistorically inventing “scientific method” as means of critical inquiry into the mysteries of creation.</div><div>Awakened academia’s few responses to this “manuscript” are largely dismissive. Mysterium critics cite the absurdly high degree of similarity between the words and deeds of the character as recorded in this supposedly archaic source and another obscure character known variously as “Quantus” or “Hypercrites,” whose bulging eyes and knowing leer appear in the background of Harvey Kurtzman periodicals, Jay Ward animations, Stan Freberg advertisements and a number of underground comics throughout the 1970s. (All appearances are now prized collector’s items; some Threnodists treat them like holy relics.) Even these detractors, however, laud the scholarship that went into the production of this virtual forgery.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Actual Occasions</h3><div>Apocryphal mythography aside, the verifiable roots of the Threnodic Legacy can be traced back to the 1920s, and one of the pioneers of quantum mathematics, the French aristocrat Prince Louis de Broglie. The Prince began as an ecclesiastical historian, but he turned his intellect toward the nascent technology of radio during World War I. Afterwards, de Broglie continued researching electromagnetism. His PhD thesis at the Sorbonne argued that ordinary gross matter possessed a wave-like aspect, in wavelengths tiny enough to account for the wave-particle duality exhibited in subatomic events. De Broglie’s professor had difficulty accepting the thesis, but when the great Einstein vouched for its mathematical proof, the Prince’s name was permanently inscribed in the textbooks of scientific history.</div><div>A name not found in the textbooks, however, is that of de Broglie’s assistant (some say “crony”) M. Auguste Etienne-Laurent, le Comte d’Erlette, a descendant of the infamous demonologist who penned Cultes des Goules. This Count, heir to a considerable body of religious (and sacrilegious) lore, had been the Prince’s friend since their earliest days as church historians. The two remained associates up until the years in which quantum theory was first formulated. D’Erlette’s memoirs — never published but preserved as required reading by Threnodic purists — recount the adventures the two aristocrats shared in the world of ideas and indicate the causes of a personal rift that ultimately resulted in the dissolution of their friendship around the time de Broglie presented his Sorbonne thesis. The Prince eventually renounced all association with the Count, and even recanted the original interpretation of his mathematical breakthrough. For the rest of his long life, de Broglie, along with Einstein and others, supported the refutation of Heisenberg’s Copenhagen Interpretation in a rival interpretation dubbed “neo-realism.” This interpretation of quantum theory sustains the mechanistic, object-based worldview of classical physics but fails to adequately account for non-local phenomena. Private undocumented conversations reveal that de Broglie also felt a more deeply seated psychological revulsion to his erstwhile colleague.</div><div>During the Great War, d’Erlette claimed he heard voices in radio static. Many radio operators — including such pioneers as Tesla — noted this phenomenon, dubbed “ghost voices.” D’Erlette, however, believed that these voices addressed him personally. The Count continued to experiment with radio through the post-war years, fine-tuning his equipment to the point that he could carry on extensive dialogues with these voices. Citing d’Erlette’s transcriptions of his otherworldly dialogues, de Broglie pointed out that these voices, with their veiled hints of cosmic revelations and personal power, resemble nothing more or less than the promises offered by medieval demons.</div><div>Threnodists say the scientific community tacitly blacklisted M. le Comte d’Erlette, though there is no way of verifying this assertion. What can be verified is that he retired to his family estate to experiment in private. His only contacts were other gifted physicists on the verge of Awakening. Thus was Threnodism born. The Legacy’s name comes from a suggestion made by a Greek student. From threnody, a wailing dirge or lament, the name may refer to the “sound” of the probability waveforms underlying physical existence, the echoes of the Big Bang that form the background noise of radio astronomy or the howls of Pandemonium.</div><div>The first generation of Threnodists were as reclusive as their founder, shunned by the scientific community that spawned them and largely unaware of other mages. These Threnodists labored in isolation, filtering their discoveries into the academic establishment through intermediaries and fronts. These mages avoided accusations of crackpottery only because their Sleeper colleagues propounded, tested and verified theories that were almost as bizarre. In the mid-1950s, however, contingents from the Guardians of the Veil began visiting Threnodist symposia to explain in no uncertain terms the need for secrecy and discretion in matters magical. The Free Council intervened shortly thereafter to help the Threnodists understand their heritage as Awakened beings.</div><div>By the late 1960s and early 1970s, some Threnodists found that pure physics had lost its challenge for those able to break its laws at will. Since perception, awareness and consciousness played significant roles in nearly every interpretation of quantum theory, many Wailers turned their inquisitive wills upon the fields of psychology and neurology. Other Wailers saw in the growing New Age movement a chance to unite the scientific with the supernatural in a public way that could eventually lead to a greater Awakening for the human race as a whole. Still other Threnodists focused on the rapid expansion and increasing sophistication of computers and communications technology as media for the working of the will. Since this time, Threnodism has diversified dramatically while remaining an extremely small and obscure Legacy. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2>Most mages ignore Threnodists as harmless madmen, since most mages have difficulty figuring out what any given Threnodist is talking about. Some particularly vocal Threnodists, however, have been denounced as harmful madmen whose brains are infested with demons (which, according to Threnodist theory, they are.) The only order that has so far accepted this Legacy within its ranks is the Free Council, although some of its leaders have had second thoughts about this decision. A few scientifically literate or broad-minded Mysterium mages privately sympathize with the Wailers, but, so far, the order’s leaders block Threnodist attempts to join, and expel mages who embrace the Legacy. <h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Explicate Order </h3><div>Aside from the Free Council, the Mysterium has the most contact with this Legacy, though rarely of the order’s own volition. The scholars find themselves besieged with requests to read and even borrow ancient or obscure texts — not to mention dangerously volatile substances, rare materials or unique and irreplaceable objects — that some Threnodist absolutely requires to complete years of research or make some earth-shattering scientific breakthrough. Many Threnodists seem to treat the Mysterium’s libraries as some sort of back-up data storage facility; the order is always receiving bulky shipments and long, system-clogging e-mails filled with reports, theses, notes, articles and reams of raw experimental data. No one can accuse the Threnodists of being stingy with their information.</div><div>Threnodism has not eluded other accusations, though. While the Threnodists never challenged any order’s leadership and maintain an apolitical stance, the Legacy’s wild pronouncements and critical attitudes are seen as a threat by the Silver Ladder. The Guardians of the Veil express concern that this Legacy may reveal too many Supernal secrets to Sleeper scientists, but investigation fails to prove that quantum theory was directly influenced by its parallel magical philosophy. Rather, the direct influence seems to go the other way. A young Legacy by Awakened standards, the Threnodists have no history of corruption within their ranks. The Guardians, however, believe that a Threnodic Scelestus was crucially involved in the development of the atom bomb (though they won’t release the name of their suspect). For several years, the Guardians have tried to enlist the Adamantine Arrow in organizing a good, old-fashioned inquisitorial witch-hunt to root out this unnamed mage’s foul lineage. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Implicate Order </h3><div>The way Threnodism organizes itself reflects the interplay between unity and diversity that forms the Legacy’s philosophical underpinnings. Unity comes from common adherence to quantum theory. Diversity comes from the broad applicability of quantum principles to studies and activities beyond physics. Some divide Threnodism into two camps, the “purists” and the “eclectics.” The former is characterized by a specificity of approach and direction, and what others view as a preoccupation with physical phenomena in the material world. This can be attributed to their origins during the first half of the past century, a time when quantum theory was the exclusive province of the physical sciences. The “eclectics” are the vanguard of more recent developments in the diffusion of quantum thought throughout the scientific world and beyond. Some Wailers like to joke that these two camps represent the “particle” and “wave” aspects of their Legacy.</div><div>The purists maintain close lines of communication and engage in great experiments that may take several generations to bear fruit. Such tutor-to-student lines follow a more rigid academic model, keeping strict accordance with scientific method even when investigating the vagaries of magical phenomena. Thorough documentation and accurate record keeping are hallmarks of these lineages, and so they are more likely to have contact with the Mysterium. Oddly enough, purist lineages are also the most naturally fractious, even though they are generally free of the academic-industrial sponsorship that fuels competition and hinders cooperation among Sleeper scientists. Other mages view the purists as succumbing to the academic tendency toward hair-splitting debates of nigh-rabbinical exactitude, with reputations and even souls used as stakes in competition between pet theories. </div><div>At the opposite extreme are the “eclectics,” divergent lineages whose interests reflect the diffusion of quantum principles into other sciences beside physics. Chemists, biologists, ecologists, neurologists, psychologists and even disciples of the “soft” social sciences have found that equations originally devised to elucidate the subatomic world prove useful in their own respective fields. Despite the broad differences between these fields, inheritors of these eclectic lineages are sociable and gregarious, both with each other and with the purists. Meetings and interdisciplinary symposiums are frequent, and marked by a high degree of enthusiasm and a free exchange of theoretical speculation and experimental data. While Wailers may pursue a wide range of interests, all Wailers recognize that they share common ground in their particular scientific approach and acknowledge the shared magical ancestry that their Legacy derives from an overarching Supernal truth. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Quantum Vacuum</h3><div>Threnodists stand apart from other Mastigos in that they do not take the apparent unity and coherence of their own ego-identities as an unquestioned assumption. Everything in the world, people included, consists of nested hierarchies of demonic intelligences, just as the human psyche is composed of nested hierarchies of thought, feeling, memory and myriad other brain functions. The ego thus seems to disintegrate under close inspection; “I” actually means an ever-changing “We.” Most mages equate such ego-disintegration with madness and loss of will, so the very notion frightens them to their core. Threnodism, however, likens consciousness and its attendant sense of self-identity to a “Bose-Einstein condensate,” a system that behaves in a more unified manner as its overall energy level increases.</div><div>(Although Albert Einstein found quantum mechanics personally dissatisfying as a scientific theory, his incisive critiques and “thought-experiments” designed to disprove its wilder implications served to reinforce and refine it — increasing its energy level as a system, one might say. Many of the thought-experiments he devised were later performed in actuality and produced results that he contraindicated, proving the predictive power of the quantum equations. Despite Einstein’s opposition, his role in the formation of quantum theory means that his name is irrevocably embedded in many key concepts.)</div><div>One specific example of such a condensate is the laser beam, wherein light particles that would normally scatter in all directions are focused into a single coherent ray and the heat energy thus delivered is highly amplified. Citing ancient occult traditions that equate consciousness with light, Threnodism draws parallels with the concentration of will, the focus and amplification of intention, that every mage must learn in order to fully utilize his powers. Just as any Mastigos must hone his will by focusing it through the Iron Gauntlet, so too must the student of Threnodism learn to channel the light of his awareness through the ruby lens of coherence and focus the laser beam of his will to act as control for the experiments he performs in the laboratory of the universe.</div><div>Another example of the condensate is a superconductor, a substance in which the alignment of its component atoms allows electricity to flow with minimal resistance. Threnodism compares this to the highly “suggestible” ephemera of the spirit world, which display superconductive properties with respect to conscious energies. Threnodists suggest that hyper-dimensional fractal systems of pure awareness, or spirits, may act as part of David Bohm’s “hidden variable” in the physical world. The accomplished Threnodist understands consciousness as a non-local attribute of the universe, manifesting as anything from an animal or tree to the shades of the departed or the principles of cosmic order personified as angelic intelligence. Being a scientist, however, she scrutinizes their ephemeral substance in its finest particulate aspect and finds that it is essentially demonic in nature.</div><div>The quanta of Sleeper physics are described as “tendencies toward existence,” waveforms that mathematically depict the probability of a quantum event occurring, for instance, the odds that an electron will strike a TV screen in one place or another. Quantum demons as defined by Threnodism are “the intention to exist,” consciousness manifesting at such a rudimentary level that it is meaningless to speak of these demons in terms of a “mind” with distinct functions and contents. They are raw subjectivity reaching toward an object that is not there and, by pure act of will, becoming that object for itself. Quantum demons occupy a hyper-dimensional vacuum of which our physical world is only a single aspect; other aspects may be experienced as other realms, interacting with ours only indirectly through the wave function. Human minds, for instance, are emergent properties of nervous systems inhabiting three-dimensions-plus-time, with manifold inner dimensions of thought that Threnodists see as the superimposed waveforms of other dimensions in varying degrees.</div><div>Quantum demons can combine to form aggregate systems, minds every bit as complex as any human psyche — or in some cases even more so — and these are the demonic intelligences known to Sleeper legend and mage experience. As emergent properties of the void itself, they remain ontologically antecedent to higher-order phenomena such as time and space, and so exhibit such qualities as non-local faster-than-light information transfer (telepathy, the Arcanum of Mind) and even the breakdown of space-like separation itself (teleportation, the Arcanum of Space). The hyper-dimensional vacuum is thus experienced as a riotous Pandemonium of ever-emerging wills-to-exist, combining to form more and more complex and energetic unified systems, demon lords that compete for power and seek to impose their existence upon the physical world through the superimposed waveforms of human thought.</div><div>This incessant activity of primordial interactions is perceived as the “wailing” or “howling” that other Mastigos call the “Goetia.” It is the same substrate from which all human (and other) thought emerges, the material of which all consciousness — according to Threnodism — is made. Goetia resounds in the private silences of the brain, where the firing of synapses between neurons can be heard as the conversation between demons in Pandemonium and in the outermost void of intergalactic space, where the shockwaves of creation yet echo. For the Threnodist, only a condensate of consciousness, energized by the scourge of critical inquiry and unified in the gauntlet of mathematic discipline, may listen to those strains and retain its identity. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Originally, only mages who Awakened as a result of their scientific studies were inducted into this Legacy. The academic prerequisites were so convolutedly arcane that these early purists seldom saw any possibly of synthesis between their own studies and the myriad esotericisms of willworking. For the first few decades of their existence, Threnodists saw themselves less as mages and more as members of the applied branch of the new theoretical physics. Tutors would not even accept pupils until they had submitted lengthy theses demonstrating their understanding of quantum mechanics.</div><div>Purists consider a solid understanding of advanced mathematics, physics and critical inquiry to be a prerequisite for any student. Formerly, this sort of training was available only to those with the financial means to choose the quality of their education. Broader historical trends culminating in the information age have made it increasingly possible for a less-moneyed person who is sufficiently motivated or gifted to acquire the necessary skills.</div><div>Not all Threnodic tutors accept pupils solely on the basis of scientific training. Some Wailers recognize that, just as the principles of quantum theory have much deeper existential and experiential roots, true understanding of those principles need not be confined to an educated elite. Despite academic objections, many of the characteristic elements of quantum theory can be understood intuitively, without intensive mathematical and scientific preparation. (Even tutors who subscribe to this view insist on some degree of training, however; second and third attainments are seldom taught to pupils without at least three dots in Science.)</div><div>One result of this increase in prerequisite latitude has been a covert search for intellectual prodigies, whether mathematical savants who can leapfrog over the stupefying calculations needed to ground quantum miracles in the solid bedrock of probative science or those who possess a simple intuitive capacity to visualize (or otherwise imagine) vague, complex and intangible microcosmic interactions. Such individuals are rare, of course. Also, such prodigious gifts may propel a mage to the heights of magical accomplishment but do not necessarily impart the moral wisdom that constitutes the highest degrees of true enlightenment.</div><div>Concurrent with this newfound latitude is a new trend that disturbs and even horrifies outsiders to this Legacy. Just as quantum mechanics introduced an element of madness into the “sanity” of rational science, Threnodism now not only admits but actively welcomes pupils with clinical histories of mental illness. Of course, most practitioners of magic have traditionally been receptive to (and probably even originated) romantic notions of divine madness. Any willworker is likely to have a historical understanding of how childhood trauma was induced to create a shaman, or how the “falling sickness” of epilepsy was taken as a sign of witchcraft. Even the most sophisticated, modern mage, however, can fall prey to the superstitions that still surround common cognitive dysfunctions. Many people equate neurological disease and psychological disorder with corruption, malice or some sort of spiritual deficiency. The documented existence of deranged but benevolent mages and rational Scelesti puts the lie to this view.</div><div>Threnodism points out that most criteria for sanity and spiritual wholeness rely upon an ideological framework of reason, order and almost mechanistic functionality. Quantum psychology, on the other hand, notes that consciousness retains an ability to cohere and to maintain an identity even in the absence of the aforementioned traits. Furthermore, some extreme forms of madness such as schizophrenia, multiple personality disorder and delusional paranoia actually appear to grant the sufferer keener insight into the quantum world, with the deep internal structure of the “deranged” psyche mirroring the greater external cosmology. Some Threnodists go on to say that this applies not only to Pandemonium, but to the entire Supernal World as well. Such pronouncements, of course, have done this Legacy no good in the eyes of mage society at large.</div><div>This said, the higher degrees of initiation still require the pupil to demonstrate a working knowledge of quantum theory and to apply its convoluted mathematical formulae to actual experience. Mathematical theory becomes the framework for interaction with quantum-demonic intelligences. Initiates who do not come from a scientific background might get this training in reverse order, learning scientific means of dealing with previous intrusions of the supernatural into their lives. Ultimately, however, attainments are not bestowed until some thesis — whether written or oral, theoretical or applied — is presented to a tutor, wherein the results of direct experience and experiment are synthesized with a formally codified system — which could be derived from sources as diverse as King Solomon’s Goetia and Von Neumann’s Die Grundlagen.</div>",
        "magic": "",
        "attainmentsDescrizione": "<div>Being Mastigos, Threnodists naturally tend toward higher aptitudes in the Arcana of Mind and Space. This accords with their interpretation of quantum mechanics, wherein these two fields are held to be reflections of each other as the observer creates the observation. Most purists study Matter and Forces as well, as these were the original bases from which quantum theory emerged. Further elaborations led to theories concerning the nature of time that were hitherto only envisioned by experts in the Arcanum bearing that name.</div><div>With the increasing diversification of the eclectics, study of other Arcana has flourished. Use of the Life Arcanum in this respect has seen widespread activity, echoed by numerous pop texts on “quantum healing.” Heisenberg’s probability matrices and Schrodinger’s waveform equations are used to produce effects that can only be associated with the Fate Arcanum. Non-Boolean logic and fractal geometry has been applied to untangle the mysteries of Spirit. Prime has evoked exceptional interest, with the astronomical quantities involved in its calculation, but few Threnodists have attempted to deal with the dauntingly low amplitudes and frequencies that characterize Death.</div><div>During the heyday of the purists, Threnodic magic was heavily oriented toward bulky technological foci, which limited their more spectacular effects to laboratories equipped with lasers, particle accelerators, cloud chambers, crystal set radios, gigantic vacuum-tube computers and the like. In the ’60s and ’70s, transistor radios were popular among young eclectics who found the variability of the analog tuning system highly useful for manipulating the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The revolution in digital technology has granted the modern Threnodist more mobility and discretion, focusing magic through cell phones, camcorders and laptops. One focus that has never gone out of style, however, is old-fashioned pencil and paper: With the Threnodists’ reliance upon mathematics, all Threnodists learn to focus their will through an idiosyncratic script that uses barbarous names as terms in long complex equations and blends Minkowski and Feynman diagrams with Goetic sigils. Another tradition is the spoken invocation of the names and theories enshrined in the history of quantum mechanics, so that a Threnodist making magic sounds as if she were delivering an oral thesis to a board of professors. For quick spellcasting, Threnodists rely on little more equipment than their more traditional colleagues in magic, or none; the quantum demons respond less effectively to “virtual” tools than to rarified equipment in a Threnodist’s hands, but they do respond. For extended spellcasting, however, purist Wailers frequently retreat to laboratory-sanctums equipped with a full complement of scientific apparatus as well as a blackboard with lots of chalk.</div>",

Information, being neither matter nor energy, can break this cosmic speed limit with impunity, using the wave function as a sort of “carrier signal” instead of light.</div><div>A mage can gain visual information about that place, as described by the Space 2 spell “Scrying,” by attuning her own waveform with that of a distant location. The information thus acquired need not be limited to the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The mage may also employ the Mind 1 spell “Third Eye” to increase her own perceptual frequencies, enabling her to receive information from the more subtle ranges of the spectrum of magical energy. Furthermore, inclusion of the Mind Arcanum allows for observation of unquantifiable neural states that would otherwise remain unobserved, effectively disclosing David Bohm’s “hidden variable.”</div><div>Any Threnodist understands that it is impossible to observe an event without affecting its outcome — as Heisenberg demonstrated with his uncertainty principle. By using this attainment, however, the mage can minimize her degree of involvement to an infinitesimal (or quantal) amount, nearly approaching the state of complete detachment that classical physics once postulated for all observers. This will not, however, spare her any backlash if her social ineptitude reveals her as a habitual eavesdropper or voyeur.</div>",

He’s been right for 40 years, and this theory was canonized as “Moore’s Law.”</div><div>Some might say that this idea applies to all current technological and scientific development. Over the last century and into this one, progress looks truly exponential. In every field, whether robotics or pharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence or biotechnology, the evolution of human knowledge arcs upwards with an astounding curve. What humans have achieved during the last two millennia pales in comparison to what humanity has achieved during the last 100 years. And, in some fields, what humanity has realized in the last 10 years easily dwarfs everything of the last 100. </div><div>Enter the Transhuman Engineers. The mages of this Legacy believe wholeheartedly in the ever-accelerating growth of technology. They see the entire depth and breadth of history as a slowly gathering storm of possibility. The Fallen World has taken its time building steam to this level of raw potential, but that is how it should be. If a child accepts an allowance raise of a single cent that doubles every week, he doesn’t see any significant growth for what feels like forever. But, as the weeks go on, he finds that, suddenly, his allowance skyrockets, and his meager piggy bank can no longer hold the sudden rise in his childhood income. In a year, this doubling allowance would bankrupt the planet. This world has taken a long time to get to here, inching forward step by step in its crawl toward development. But this is now the point at which progress is only just beginning. </div><div>With technology advancing in this way, the mages of this Legacy believe humanity will soon reach a point of Singularity. In mathematics, a singularity is a point at which calculation breaks down. A curve leaps to infinity. Technological singularity is the same, except here humankind’s progress will grow to a point that nothing can stay the same and everything must change. Artificial intelligence surpasses our own. Lifespans stretch forever outward, granting everyone equal eternities. Flesh and machine merge. In this scenario, humans are no longer human, but post-human. </div><div>This is what the Transhuman Engineers want, and this is what they try to achieve.

Will the Fallen and the Supernal Worlds reunite? Will all of the Sleepers have their eyes torn open? Will all things unite and become one? The Engineers don’t know.

A few Engineers parade around in garish makeup straight from cyberpunk movies such as Blade Runner, or adopt industrial piercings and unconventional tattoos (binary code, JavaScript, faux-circuitry).

The most important are the Legacy’s “Expos.” Once a year, invitations go out (via e-mail or text message) to the various Engineers. They meet at a prepared and protected location and show off what they’ve done and seen. Some Engineers create elaborate technical displays, whereas others hold a number of disquisitions and colloquia on any number of subjects — from medical nanotechnology to the artificial intelligence of upcoming video games. Other Engineers just sit in the bar and drink. Past Expos have been held on a hidden floor in the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, in the desert near Los Alamos, and in the tunnels below the Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technical Museum in Bangalore. At least a third of the Engineers do not come physically, but attend the Expos via some manner of telepresence.</div><div>The Engineers occasionally build communal citadels in the Obrimos fashion. They don’t care for peaceful cloisters; innovation is not found in a vacuum. Prime Movers place their citadels where people and ideas gather and compete: in downtown city centers, on the most traveled highways and byways or among the throngs of students at huge universities.

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>The Engineers are unexpectedly numerous for a relatively new Legacy. Their history, as such, is not particularly long. They do claim an unofficial heritage of various mages, however.</div><div>The Transhuman Engineers trace their heritage backward to various Free Council mages over the last century. These mages acted as muses to various significant figures of scientific and technological development and are said to have helped shepherd the destinies and inventions of paragons such as Nikola Tesla (genius of electrical engineering), Wernher von Braun (pioneer of rocket technology), Philo Farnsworth (inventor of the TV) and Allen Newell (originator of theoretical cognitive AI).</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>V.V.</h3><div>V.V. is the Free Council mage who first crafted his soul in an effort to help push society toward a technological singularity. He takes his shadow name from the initials of a prominent science fiction author whose novels and essays helped introduce the idea of the Singularity. The founder of the Prime Movers believes that the Fallen World is on the cusp of a technological singularity, and that forces conspire to keep the Fallen World from going further. By driving technology forward with compulsive devotion, the Transhuman Engineers can help bring the world to Supernal enlightenment.</div><div>V.V. is still around. Few mages see him anymore; he is rumored to be working on “something big,” though precisely what it is remains a secret. Mages who’ve worked with V.V. say he has a number of leading Sleeper scientists and inventors as his cronies, and what he is planning will change the world forever — one way or another.</div><div>V.V. leads a fluctuating cabal of mages young and old. Prime Movers consider it a great honor to be invited to meet V.V. and help him achieve his goals. Some mages who meet with him return to the world a month or a year later, wild-eyed with newfound enthusiasm for their crusades. Other mages do not return at all.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>While the Engineers have an informal (some would even say scattershot) organization, they still have a formalized culture. The Prime Movers endeavor to instill in their apprentices similar values, ideas and teachings. What these apprentices do with such lessons is up to them, but the Legacy considers it important that they all begin with a few shared precepts.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Action and Inspiration</h3><div>For mages who think about crafting their souls in the forge of this Legacy, it comes down to the simple question of what do the Engineers do? The Prime Movers don’t require their mages to “do” anything except support technological progress. That’s it. Many mages ignore technology, or show contempt for it. The Engineers think this is short-sighted. Like it or not, they say, technology is the ladder upon which humankind climbs. To eschew technology means to forego progress. And progress is everything: it is the way the Fallen World will bridge the Abyss and reach the Supernal.</div><div>To the mages of this Legacy, progress means using technology and be seen using it. Many Engineers stay on the bleeding edge of technology. These early adopters buy whatever comes to market, no matter how expensive or impractical. If the product comes emblazoned with the hottest or weirdest technological buzzword, the mage probably wants it. Teraflops, telemedicine, bioinformatics, Bluetooth, pixel-shader effects, Turing tests — these are the words of the Prime Movers, and this language changes and grows daily. Owning the latest, gee-whizziest techno-toy is not mandatory. In fact, some Engineers cherish antiquated technology such as BBS’s or ham radio. Slipping off the bleeding edge, however, does tend to reduce status within the Legacy.</div><div>Transhuman Engineers don’t just use the latest technology. Some of them create it, too. A number of Prime Movers are themselves inventors, programmers or scientists. They try to push the limits of technology and magic alike. They imbue machines with magic; they use magic to further their scientific and technological research. (Of course, they realize that magic cannot be technology’s sole component or driving force. Humanity must be able to harness and create technology for it to drive humankind toward the Singularity.) These mages do not work in isolation, and prefer to surround themselves with other mages, Sleepwalkers or even Sleepers who can contribute to whatever overarching design goal drives these Engineers. Engineers of this stripe are found in wildly varying fields — their crusades might mean helping map the genomes, building the world’s largest Wi-Fi Internet-access “bubble” or helping to feed starving nations through biotechnology. No field is off-limits.</div><div>Still other Transhuman Engineers motivate and inspire their Sleeper colleagues. These mages become muses for the creators and architects of new technology. An Engineer could anonymously e-mail an inventor tips, tricks, insider information or even stolen or classified data. Alternatively, the mage could develop a close, personal relationship with the Sleeper. The Engineers often become friends or lovers to mortals they perceive as innovators like themselves. If this means buddying up to a video game designer with an interest in artificial intelligence, so be it. If it requires becoming lover to an inventor on the political and cultural fringe, then that’s what’s necessary. The Engineer can help shepherd the individual’s progress, which might mean salving a damaged ego, leaving little “hints” behind illustrating mistakes or corrupted data or helping to foster much-needed competition (for competition breeds progress).</div><div>For example, a Prime Mover might build an Enhanced or Imbued device that does something just outside the current range of expected technology. The device provides a feature or service that has long been sought after, but has not yet been achieved. Perhaps the Engineer offers a robot that can run (a long-existing stumbling block for inventors of bipedal robots), or maybe designs an engine that uses fuel more efficiently than anything in current production. The Engineer can show this “prototype” to a handful of Sleeper inventors (either by bragging about it or by purposefully leaving the specs where a Sleeper can find them) and say that, gosh, he sure hopes nobody beats him to market. With that said, the mage can stand back and let the competitive tech sector go to battle over designing the same or similar prototypes. What once needed magic becomes real. The Prime Movers say the trick has worked dozens of times.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Core Tenets</h3><div>Tutors of the Transhuman Engineers teach their apprentices the following tenets. An apprentice doesn’t have to agree with these precepts, though open disavowal of them may earn her more than just a disgruntled look. More than one Engineer has lost status within the Legacy by mocking one or another tenet when other Engineers could hear.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Unopposed Progress</h4><div>Innovation cannot be opposed. People who block advances in technology are enemies of the Transhuman Engineers. The world moves toward an ineluctable point, a wonderful and necessary sublimation in which primitive humanity (i.e., the human race as it is now) becomes something greater, something different. Anyone who places roadblocks in the way of this objective is hurting the world. Such a person denies the Supernal. </div><div>Most Engineers take a subtle approach. If a pharmaceutical company deems a potential new drug non-profitable and tries to bury the project, an Engineer might steal the formula and give it to someone who will produce the drug. If a politician stands in the way of pro-technology or scientific legislation, the mage might dig up some dirt on the politico (an affair, an old DUI charge, a scandalous investment) and blackmail her into “going with the flow.”</div><div>Not all Prime Movers are so restrained, however. Some Engineers engage in acts that other mages see as dangerous or cruel. In the case of the aforementioned politician, the Engineer might forge evidence of a scandal (easily done with magic), threaten her or her family — or worse, simply assassinate or brainwash her. If a group openly opposes animal testing, even when such experimentation can save human lives, a Prime Mover might “dissuade” the group from further interference. It’s regrettable if such dissuasion takes the form of coercion, torture or turning the members into lab animals themselves, but sometimes maintaining progress means making hard decisions. In this way, Engineers can become extremists as their Wisdom drops. Where once they might have taken a delicate tack in removing the obstacles of innovation, they eventually decide on more excessive (but “necessary”) tactics to preserve the flow of information and advancement. </div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Unfettered Access to Technology</h4><div>Not only should progress remain unopposed, its benefits must be available for everybody’s benefit. How can technology change the world if it stays in the jealous hands of an elitist few?</div><div>Many Engineers strive to expand access to modern technology. Why shouldn’t the homeless have cell phones? Why can’t a small African village connect to the Internet, have its own website and be entirely wireless? Whatever technology the Engineers possess, others should equally be allowed to have. In some cases, this means the Engineers purchase or steal technology, and distribute it among the masses like some kind of tech-obsessed Robin Hood. In other cases, the Prime Movers teach others how to pilfer their own tech. Perhaps the Engineers impart the secrets of hacking wireless networks or using peer-to-peer (P2P) pirate networks. The Engineers agree that the power of technology should be free, and one should make the utmost effort to keep it that way.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Anti-Corporate Attitude</h4><div>This Legacy upholds a somewhat counterintuitive — some might even say hypocritical — outlook toward corporations. Without funding from big companies, a lot of technological research just wouldn’t happen. And yet, the Engineers still purport that corporations ultimately hurt advancement more than helping it.</div><div>The reason for this is that corporations are driven by their profit margins; any technology advanced by the corporations is geared toward their bottom line. How many possibilities have been pushed aside in the name of money? The corporations are not altruistic. They don’t push the envelope based on humanity’s needs — only the needs of their stockholders.</div><div>In fact, tutors in this Legacy teach their apprentices a number of corporate-level conspiracies. The pharmaceutical companies keep the cure for cancer hidden, because imperfect drugs and therapies make too much money. The oil companies similarly suppress the engines that run by splitting water molecules. The electric companies (in tandem with various world governments) keep Nikola Tesla’s papers under wraps — not because he designed powerful weapons that could fall into the wrong hands, but because he designed technologies to deliver free wireless electricity. A number of Engineers claim they have proof of such conspiracies, though few will show the evidence to anybody outside the Legacy. (And, in the World of Darkness, of course, many conspiracies are true.)</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Technology Will Become Magic</h4><div>The Transhuman Engineers believe that true technology invites magic from the Supernal and enlivens the Fallen World. Occultist Aleister Crowley called magic “the art of causing change according to Will.” The Prime Movers say technology fits that definition, too. As humanity controls the physical world more completely and more invasively through technology, brute matter becomes imbued with meaning. Technology, therefore, is the only part of culture (not art, politics or academics) that actively draws down and captures this mystery.</div><div>Modern technology comes closer than anything else to letting a Sleeper feel like a mage, too: will it, and it shall be so. Flick a switch, press a button or type a password and a thousand hidden forces and electromechanical djinni are at your command.</div><div>All of this ever-increasing knowledge and power converges in the Singularity. The Prime Movers believe the Exarchs won’t be able to keep up with their Sleeping prisoners. The scientists will catch the Exarchs in their Lie and expose the secret, Supernal underpinnings of reality, the technologists will apply their discoveries and, thus, will the entire world be transformed.</div><div>Religion? Politics? Art? The Transhuman Engineers don’t think those fields bring Supernal influences to the Fallen World. At best, religion, politics and art are amusements; at worst, they are deceits to propagate the Lie. Only technology can change the world.</div><div>In this way, the Prime Movers’ views are very limited, and they clash sometimes even with the rest of the Free Council. Libertines acknowledge technology’s power but do not focus solely upon it. The Engineers do.</div>",
        "magic": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magical Technology</h2><div>Prime Movers make frequent use of Enhanced and Imbued technological items. They even find a few Artifacts of technology that somehow captured Supernal power. An example might be an Imbued MP3 player that uses Forces and Space magic to pick up frequencies from across the world — or Mind magic to hear the thoughts of people nearby. Transhuman Engineers make heavy use of Enhanced items, which allow for subtle advantage out in the field (and the Engineers prefer to avoid Paradox for obvious reasons). Usually, an Enhanced item in the hands of a Prime Mover simply provides an equipment bonus toward its use — a laptop that gives a bonus when performing research, a cell phone that offers advantage when transmitting viruses to other cell phones or a Taser weapon that fires with unerring accuracy. </div><div>Prime Movers almost invariably dedicate technological devices as magical tools. (These often relate to an individual mage’s chosen crusade). Any Free Council mage can do this as his order tool, of course, but Transhuman Engineers may dedicate high-tech Path tools, too. The device echoes a classic Path tool through its form or function: similar to a mirror, a picture phone captures an image; a Taser is as much a weapon as any spear or dagger. And what could represent an Obrimos mage’s affinity for Forces better than a device that actually carries and manipulates energy through circuits and batteries?</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Gadget Acquisition</h3><div>Transhuman Engineers usually own a great deal of technology. It is not unusual to see a Prime Mover saddled with two iPods, a GPS device, wireless headphones, smart sneakers, a PDA, a keychain full of JumpDrives, a digital camera the size of a credit card, a handheld gaming device and a couple of different digital phones. Their sanctums are often similarly loaded with gadgetry: robotic “toys,” kitchen appliances that connect to the Internet, LCD screens on every wall acting as windows, several PCs and so forth. Prime Movers often own a number of “black” technologies (i.e., items that have yet to be mass-produced or announced to the public) such as stealth surveillance devices, transparent silicon circuitry, hologram monitors or biometric eye-scanners.</div><div>Such items are not only expensive but, in many cases, impossible to actually own. Some Engineers are wealthy, but few are wealthy enough to support their excessive “habits.” Transhuman Engineers don’t always stay within the law. Mages of this Legacy are not only allowed to use magic to pilfer new technology, they are encouraged to do so. If progress is meant to be unopposed and available to all, the Engineers see little issue with taking it for themselves using the tools at hand.</div><div>The Engineers’ overwhelming passion for technology can hobble them in some circumstances. They rely so heavily upon their gadgets that being without them is tantamount to total helplessness. Woe to the unfortunate Prime Mover who finds himself in the wilderness without GPS tracking, a digital phone and an air-conditioned weatherproof tent.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Vogue Tech</h4><div>While all technology is created equal in the eyes of the Prime Movers, some forms of tech are more “in vogue” than others:</div></div><div><b>AI:</b> Artificial intelligence is a crusade among many Engineers. In true AI, the mechanism would transcend itself and deterministic programs would become creative thought. Right now, two schools of thought compete for attention among the Prime Movers. One theory says that artificial intelligence should be made in the image of humans and that computers should learn to think with the free logic of which a human is capable. Other mages seek what is called “emergent technology,” in which the system intelligence is given the adaptability of an ant colony. While individual ants are stupid and capable of only the simplest acts, an entire colony performs complex feats of creation and survival. These “multi-agents” might help resolve urban traffic flow, information retrieval, medical diagnosis, even pizza delivery.</div><div><b>Cyborgs:</b>  The Prime Movers have their share of cyborgs among them. A “cyborg” isn’t a full-blown Terminator, but simply a human who has technology integrated into his body. Examples include pacemakers, tracking devices, microchips that monitor health and life signs and digital phone receivers planted in the ear. Some Engineers have “environmentally reactive” chips planted in the flesh of their arms. When an appropriately-fitted Engineer enters his home, the chip sends a signal to various parts of the house. Windows dim, lights turn on, coffee begins to brew or the house greets the mage in a pleasant voice.</div><div>Other mages conduct more radical experiments with chips implanted into their brains. With these chips, mages can control a mouse cursor or machine without touching it, because the chip allows them to do it just by thinking about it. Microchips in this fashion can also curb addictions and mental illnesses. So far, “brainchips” all require enchantment — but the Engineers think their experiments will lead to devices that Sleepers can make and use.</div><div><b>Communication:</b> The last decade has seen an explosion of communication technologies. The two paragons of this technology are the Internet and the digital phone. With this one-two punch, the world can be informed of events nigh-instantaneously. If a bomb goes off in Berlin, a remote town in Alaska can hear about it (and see pictures of it) minutes later. The Internet similarly gives everyone a voice. All are free on the Net, unhindered and equal. (The “blogger” phenomenon is a perfect example of this, and one a number of Engineers join, as well.) The Engineers want to push these technologies until humanity has what amounts to a “hive mind.” With the aforementioned brainchips, information can be relayed immediately through the global mind without hesitation or filter — someday.</div><div>Some other technologies and sciences (genegineered crops, cloning, medical tech) are regarded highly by the Transhuman Engineers but don’t often make an appearance as a Prime Mover’s crusade. While many of these technologies are touted as the “next big thing,” most mages of this Legacy have a greater knack for “hard tech” than these particular crusades. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Other Precepts</h3><div>The Transhuman Engineers follow a number of lesser “guidelines” that complement their overarching principles. These precepts are less likely to be followed with obsessive diligence, and instead provide a list of general characteristics that a mage in this Legacy might possess.</div><div><ul><li> Many Engineers complement their Forces and Prime Arcana with Matter magic. This enables their magic to control or create technology in almost any way they can imagine. </li><li>The Libraries of the Prime Movers are often more technologically byzantine than those of other Free Council mages. Engineers establish labyrinthine networks, each concealed behind firewalls, wireless access keys and biometric scanners. Some Transhuman Engineers spread their Libraries out over hundreds of DVD-ROMs or USB JumpDrives. Some Prime Movers actually make their own storage devices, items that others cannot understand to hack.</li><li>As Obrimos, the Engineers embody a kind of strength. They generally believe they are the only mages willing to guide the world toward its proper end (an “end” meaning “new beginning”). They are used to conflict, and do not avoid it. That said, despite their strengths, the Legacy openly defies the usual organizations of the Obrimos. While some mages on the Path of the Mighty find a power in uniformity, the Prime Movers disagree. They believe that, as individuals, they unconsciously work toward a singular harmony. Forcing homogeneity breeds predictability, complacency — weakness, the Engineers suggest. Therefore, the mages of this Legacy are sometimes at odds with their Obrimos allies.</li><li>Despite relying upon technology, the Prime Movers are not without occult interests. In fact, they usually inscribe their tech devices with occult symbols. In addition to the Atlantean sigils common to all mages, the Engineers often draw upon astrology and alchemy — the precursors of physical science. Some cobble together their own symbols, often mashing together various alchemical symbols (for example, the symbol of gold with a lightning strike through it, to represent the microscopic gold wiring in every computer chip).</li></ul><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>It’s not too hard to join up with the Prime Movers. For this reason, the Legacy has an unusually large number of mages in its ranks. A mage who wants to join the Transhuman Engineers faces only one test: impress me. That’s all it takes, is to impress a current standing member. Of course, impressing a Prime Mover isn’t easy, as many of them have seen it all (or believe they have). The nature of this impression is unique to each tutor. It can be as difficult and drastic as a mage showing how she podcasted from the top of Mount Everest. It can be as simple as designing a cool new GUI (graphical user interface) for a hip, pop culture website. What amuses and astounds one Engineer might bore another one.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Shadow Names</h3><div>When a mage crafts his soul in this Legacy, he chooses a new shadow name. Prime Movers often base their names on influential or revered figures of science or technology. (An Engineer usually picks someone who is dead out of respect, and also to make sure the Engineer doesn’t get confused with the still-living individual; someday, they might be in the same room.) One Prime Mover might call herself Tesla (or merely Nikola), Edison or Einstein. Prime Movers also choose names of particularly visionary science-fiction writers (again, also deceased) such as Asimov or Heinlein. Other Prime Movers choose “l33t” hacker names, the names of technological products or titles of characters from tech-friendly pop culture (maybe the film Tron). The name generally reflects the mage’s personality and his crusade. A mage devoted to non-linear emergent artificial intelligence might call himself Turing, since Alan Turing is perceived as the father of modern computer science and helped define the Turing test, a way of testing how well a program can truly mimic human behavior. (Alternately, a similarly-interested mage might name herself after a prominent computer game character in “honor” of artificial intelligence.)</div>",
        "attainmentsDescrizione": "The attainments of the Transhuman Engineers are meant to help the mages push themselves and others toward the unknown future. The Forces Arcanum represents a dynamic connection with the raw elements that drive technology. By tapping into this primal flow, the Prime Movers can connect the Fallen World to the Supernal.

Without cost, the mage can home in on any one wireless transmission with a successful Wits + Science roll. This includes transmissions of satellite television, cell phones, radio, walkie-talkie traffic, police bands and Internet wireless transmissions. The character hears the information transmitted. She cannot establish a visual connection with this information unless the player rolls an exceptional success on the Wits + Science roll. </div><div>Once the mage can hear a transmission, she can interrupt it with her own voice. She literally hijacks the feed, speaking over whatever television transmission or cell phone conversation is going on. Anyone listening or watching that particular feed at that particular moment will hear the mage speaking. The mage’s hijacked transmission is limited to a number of minutes equal to her Gnosis score. </div><div>A Prime Mover can limit her transmission to one receiver. In this way, her voice comes through to only one television set, cell phone, walkie-talkie or radio of her choosing. If she cannot see the target, however, the mage must have a sympathetic link to him. This can be the standard hair, blood sample or nail clippings, but the Engineers prefer to achieve this link through Social Security numbers, RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) badges from a person’s employer or the exact GPS coordinates of the target’s current location.</div>",

A cell phone clipped to her belt never needs a battery. All the appliances in a room receive power just from her presence. And any devices implanted in her body (whether a microchip or a pacemaker) can go forever, theoretically. Even items that require alternate sources of power are fueled by the mage’s presence.

Some Awakened scholars believe that its philosophy has always existed, in one form or another. Such allegations can neither be confirmed nor denied, however, and only a scant few facts exist to corroborate the claims of the Fangs, or of the mages who condemn them.</div><div>What is known is that the Fangs derive some measure of their power from the acamoth and their Abyss-bound kin. In the eyes of most other willworkers, this offense makes the Fangs as bad as the Scelesti. After all, how much difference can there really be between bending knee to the Devil, and making use of his tools?</div><div>In truth, the Fangs of Mara make use of the darkest of magics, though not in the same manner as the Scelesti. Rather, the Fangs wrest their attainments from the restless dreams and hideous imaginings of the demon-gods, nightmares literally beyond any human comprehension. But why? Though known to but a handful of living willworkers outside of the Legacy, the Fangs aspire to the goal of using their knowledge to destroy those elder monstrosities and, perhaps, bridging the unfathomable gulf between the Fallen World and the Supernal.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Nightmares",
        "orders": "What little the orders know about the Fangs of Mara leads most mages to abhor them — but can tempt a few. Mages of the Mysterium regard fear as a product of ignorance. Still, some wisdom might be distilled from terror or some secret lore wrested from the dreams of the native entities of the Abyss. For mages of the Adamantine Arrow and the Silver Ladder, the promise of the Nightmares is especially tempting: the fear of one’s enemies, and, potentially, critical (if cryptic) knowledge about the acamoth and the denizens of the Abyss. Of course, all but a handful of Arrow and Ladder willworkers turn away from the poisoned gifts of the Fangs, but a few succumb.<div>The Guardians of the Veil are the mages perhaps most likely to embrace the way of the Nightmares. Many Guardians are well-versed in terror tactics used to preserve the sanctity of the Mysteries. Mages in the most secretive Atlantean order can also fall prey to the romance of the hard choice and accept terrible stains upon their souls to serve some greater good. Such Guardians embrace their darkest fears, and those of others, in order to obtain the secrets they desire or to unravel the dark designs of the Abyss. Another sort of Guardian entirely is occasionally drawn to the Nightmares, one who has lost the way of Wisdom and has become a creature of the terror he creates in order to preserve the sanctity of the hidden world.The Fangs hold little attraction for the Free Council; what little the order knows about the Legacy inspires loathing, just as with most sensible mages. An unwary Libertine might seek out the Nightmares just to find out why other mages hate them so much, however, and so be ensnared.</div>",
        "appearance": "Most Nightmares try to appear relatively normal (by whatever local standards apply). After all, they have enough to worry about in dealing with other willworkers without drawing undue attention to themselves from Sleepers. Other Fangs of Mara, younger and less experienced, put on what they perceive to be frightful trappings (theatrically sinister-looking clothing, menacing tattoos or piercings, even ritual scarification or other acts of self-mutilation), but most older Nightmares look down on that sort of attention-grabbing nonsense. Of course, more powerful Fangs tend to carry an aura of dread and unease with them, no matter how they attire themselves.<div>Fangs of Mara often have an unnerving quality in their stares, somewhat akin to that seen in the eyes of a hardened killer or someone on the brink of madness. Some Fangs develop nervous habits (or maybe tics), go gray at a young age or otherwise exhibit characteristics of longtime exposure to an unhealthy amount of fear. Some Nightmares lose their appetites and become gaunt, while others have nearly constantly accelerated pulses and respiration, and seem perpetually on the verge of “fight or flight” panic. A few Fangs become the archetypal “cackling madmen,” babbling to themselves (or to anyone that will listen) about, “unspeakable terrors, roiling just beyond the edge of the mind’s eye,” and such. Aside from one or two disturbing qualities, though, most Nightmares seem ordinary enough to pass among Sleepers (or other Awakened).</div><div>Nightmares occasionally find their nimbuses twisted into terrible shapes, as the fear they hold within their souls twists the outward reflections of their Awakened power. Some Fangs manifest half-seen twisting tentacles curling around their bodies, while writhing shadows or hideous, demonic shapes loom around others. Odd tricks of space may surround a Nightmare, such as free-floating shards of a mirror or the warpage of a mirage, revealing unearthly vistas. There appears to be no rhyme or reason as to why this phenomenon happens to some Fangs and not to others.</div>",
        "background": "Prospective Fangs of Mara are often people who have, in some way, worked with fear during the course of their lives, especially those to whom fear becomes both art and science. A crude and bullying bouncer at a nightclub revels in the fear he creates, but he wields it as a blunt instrument and has no appreciation for its subtleties. A psychologist who works with sleep studies, trying to unravel the chemical and psychological causes of nightmares, on the other hand, would make an attractive recruit for the Fangs.<div>Another type of potential Fang is someone whose Sleeping life was, at some critical juncture, defined by fear and who eventually learned to overcome it. A person driven into an institution after a mind-numbing trauma, for instance, and who later conquered the terror of that event, could well be sought out by the Nightmares. So could someone with recurring night terrors who finally won out over them through force of will, rather than medication. Confronting horror is important to the Fangs of Mara, and a person who understands her own fear is a step closer to mastering all fear.</div><div>Perhaps the least common of the “default” ways by which one comes to the attention of the Fangs of Mara is to survive an encounter with an acamoth or other powerful Abyssal being. People who do so come away with scars (both physical and psychological, though only the latter interests the Nightmares). Given the rarity of willworkers who actually clash with entities of the Abyss and live to tell the tale, however, these sorts of Nightmares form a clear minority of the Legacy’s already-small membership.</div>",
        "organizzation": "The Fangs of Mara are loosely organized at best, though the mentor-student bond is a powerful one. Given the fervor with which Consilii hunt the Nightmares (if the Consilii know one is near), the Legacy needs a widespread and decentralized organization to survive. Still, the ties between teacher and student, for good or ill, help to hold them together as adherents of a single, cohesive philosophy.<div>A Nightmare usually adopts a cellular structure. Each individual Fang knows his teacher and one or two others. More powerful adherents to the Legacy often know a few more members, but even the most well-connected Nightmare doesn’t know more than seven or so others. In the rare Consilium in which the Fangs of Mara are not hunted (or, perhaps, hold sway, whether covertly or blatantly), this restriction is somewhat relaxed. Fangs from outside such Consilii, however, rarely associate with those within them. The Nightmares sensibly doubt the prospects of such a “good thing” lasting forever and know the probable consequences when it eventually goes bad.</div><div>The Fangs of Mara have killed their own over potential threats to the Legacy as a whole. For instance, a powerful and influential Nightmare captured and delivered to a Consilium could expose a significant fraction of the Legacy to danger (or at least force the Fangs to flee their current lives). Such a thing is extremely uncommon, however. Few mages from outside the Legacy combine the knowledge, desire, mystic might and opportunity needed to effectively besiege an entire (deliberately scattered) Legacy.</div><div>Outside of the mentor-student relationship, the Legacy has no formal titles, no special forms of address or ceremonial gestures of obeisance made by one Nightmare toward another. Experienced and powerful Fangs simply command the respect they feel they are due, and can make their displeasure manifest upon irreverent younger Nightmares in many awful ways. For the most part, though, young Nightmares show honor to their elders. Such willworkers have seen things that would shatter most human minds, and many of them have indulged in acts of such splendorous fear and horror that would make even the most callous and jaded mental health professional cringe.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>As one might expect for such a secretive Legacy, other mages can find little reliable information about the origins and history of the Fangs of Mara. The Fangs tell their students that the Legacy is very old, but even they don’t know their origin. Anyone inside the Legacy or out who wants to learn more must follow slender clues found in manuscripts known only to the Awakened.</div><div>For instance, a 16th-century Greek willworker known only by his shadow name, Armenius, makes reference in his journals to the destruction of a thing that may or may not have been an acamoth. It was almost certainly an Abyssal being of tremendous power. He writes of “those wise in the Power, and sworn to the service of fear,” as the mages responsible for the entity’s demise. Armenius collected his account from the lone survivor, a ranting madman. Some scholars of obscure Awakened lore believe the willworkers mentioned were Fangs of Mara. Naturally, the entry invites some uncomfortable questions for other mages about what the Nightmares want. Nightmares who have read the account believe it describes a phenomenal success on the part of their Legacy. Armenius said only that the battle took place in the Black Forest of Germany. Attempts to find the battleground so the truth might be divined with magic have so far failed.</div><div>The first mage definitively identified as a self-proclaimed “Fang of Mara” was a Silver Ladder willworker whom the Guardians of the Veil captured in London in the 1893. She had used her mastery of the mystic arts to pose as an inmate in a lunatic asylum. The Guardians caught her torturing the other inmates with terrible visions of fear, using them as studies into the tolerances of the human psyche. Under great duress, the captive revealed that she had intended to unleash the fruits of her research upon her rivals within the Ladder.</div><div>No other such reference would be heard (outside of the Legacy itself) until 1967, when a Guardian of the Veil living in Los Angeles, California, became the hollowed-out host for an Abyssal entity. After he was put down (at the cost of three mages’ lives), the papers retrieved from his home mentioned the Fangs of Mara. The documents did not make clear whether the Guardian had pursued, or aspired to pursue, the way of the Nightmares. No Fang is known to have mentored him, but the ignominy of his demise was also poor incentive for any teacher to come forward and claim him.</div><div>Since that time, the Fangs of Mara have become, slowly but surely, known among certain scholars of obscure Awakened lore. The Fangs’ appearances are always brief but always accompanied by horror. Few mages care to know much about them; some Fangs are amused by what they perceive as an “ignore it and it’ll go away” mentality. Then again, few mages have much opportunity to learn about the Fangs, anyway. Allegedly, the Fangs hide in the underbelly of Awakened society, recruiting from among infernalists with few scruples and an unhealthy fascination with the power of fear. Their critics say the Fangs are willing thralls to the acamoth and their kin in the unfathomable horror of the Abyss.</div><div>The Fangs themselves consider this a slander born of misunderstanding. While some Fangs of Mara quite probably are slaves to Abyssal entities, such Fangs are, given the Legacy’s self-appointed task, in the minority.</div><div>In fact, Fangs of Mara occasionally drop a dime on Scelesti or other slaves to dark powers (Awakened or not) to cabals or even entire Consilii. Likewise, scattered accounts circulate of mages facing off against Abyssal horrors that were only defeated through the timely intervention of a Nightmare. The stories certainly aren’t enough to make the Fangs seem trustworthy, but the Fangs in them do sometimes manage to seem noble, or at least a necessary evil. No willworker is concretely known to have slain one of the acamoth, but the Nightmares may represent the best chance the Awakened have of actually doing so.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Fangs of Mara are ill received by most Consilii that know anything about the Fangs, and most of them are thus forever mindful to keep their true natures secret. Indeed, Nightmares are exceedingly wary of other mages who learn of their Legacy. Fangs do not react with immediate hostility and violence when other mages learn their secret, if they can help it. After all, the way of fear is perilously close to the path of the Scelesti. The Fangs know that one misstep separates them from mastering the acamoth and their ilk to being mastered themselves.</div><div>Fangs often avoid prolonged contact with one another, unwilling to accept the risk to what is a relatively small Legacy. The loss of three or five Nightmares is intolerably large by their reckoning, and so they stay in contact with one another through less direct means. Communication through dreams is a common tactic for them, and they establish and destroy the connections between their members (via the Space Arcanum) as needed, making it virtually impossible for outsiders to use one Fang to track down others. Particularly potent Nightmares convene during Astral sojourns in the Temenos, though the subjects discussed during these incorporeal gatherings remain unknown to lesser Fangs.</div><div>Teachers pass on to their students the arts of working strange magics upon the acamoth and sending messages through the dreams of such beings. Any mage who has undergone the “Nightmare Journey” spell can use the Mind Arcanum to transmit messages to any other such willworker through the dreams of the acamoth. The Arcanum dot effects for such telepathic communication are as normal, but count as a “Familiar” connection and cannot be traced by mages who have not entered the nightmares of the spawn of the Abyss. Given the medium of the missives’ transmission, these missives are almost always tainted by disturbing and unearthly imagery, and unclean feelings. Individual Nightmares may know other magics worked on or through the acamoth, but these are not common to all Fangs.</div><div>Because of the Legacy’s induction practices, many students see their teachers as tormentors and hold considerable enmity toward them, even long after the students have joined the Legacy. As a whole, the Nightmares consider this arrangement a good thing: it keeps the students sharp. So long as neither the teacher’s nor the apprentice’s personal issues escalate to actual violence, the Fangs don’t usually intrude upon one another’s student-mentor relationships. Fangs who do not endure such an adversarial relationship, however, often remain close to their teachers and are happy to maintain ties to wiser and more experienced Fangs. If at all possible, however, the Nightmares keep those ties at a distance. Only in places where one or two of them are powerful enough to hold secret sway in a Consilium (or, alternately, in the rare Consilii that accept them), do they begin to demonstrate any higher level of organization.</div><div>Under very rare circumstances, a Fang will find some small measure of acceptance in “polite” Awakened society. Perhaps a particular Consilium has an exceedingly tolerant Hierarch or the Nightmare was a student or favorite of an influential Councilor before his induction. In such a case, an adherent to this Legacy can operate with reasonable safety. Slightly more often, an influential willworker understands the potential benefits from having civil, reliable, but secret, contact with a Nightmare. One never knows when the most intimate possible understanding of fear could come in handy.</div><div>The ultimate objective of the Fangs of Mara is so grandiose, and seen (by those few non-Nightmares that know if it) as such a colossal work of Hubris, as to make virtually any sane willworker see the Fangs as enemies. It takes an especially powerful sense of pride to imagine that any artifice of mortal magic could destroy the acamoth and their ilk (despite how much some mages want to believe).</div><div>The Fangs believe it, though. More even than their reverence for the power of fear, this objective — the overthrow of the lords of the Abyss — binds the Legacy together. It is the one thing they all agree upon. If the Awakened world paints the Fangs as villains because of that struggle, well, the Fangs will be vindicated in the end. History will remember them as the saviors that they are. At least, that’s how the Nightmares see things.</div><div>The Fangs of Mara have less certainty about how to achieve this great work. Some of them struggle to decipher the fever-dreams of the acamoth, certain that unlocking their unholy wisdom is the surest path to obtaining the power necessary to destroy them. Other Fangs maintain that a shift in human consciousness as a whole, affected through the medium of fear, will harden even Sleepers to the terrors of the Abyss. The Fangs agree only that that the acamoth need human dreamers. Therefore, experimenting with nightmares may expose some critical weakness within the chthonic beings’ seemingly unassailable power. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Nightmares tend to be drawn into their Legacy in one of two ways. The first way is a harrowing journey into fear, inspired by the would-be teacher without the prospective student’s knowledge or consent. Terrifying dreams await her each time her head hits the pillow and half-glimpsed visions of horror dog her waking steps. Depending upon how she reacts to the “training,” she may be approached by the Nightmare, left broken in mind and spirit or eventually left alone. Fangs inducted through such means tend either to be of higher Wisdom than the other sort, or else of very low Wisdom (having been all but broken by the tender mercies of their teachers.)</div><div>The other common path to induction begins with the prospective student approached by the mentor, and encouraged to create fear and terror in others. Of course, only a mage who seems truly receptive to this notion is offered this opportunity, save by the most foolish Nightmares (and few of those sorts survive long enough to develop their own abilities, let alone pass on anything they learned.) The end result, ideally, creates a willworker monstrous and callous enough to adopt the philosophy of the Fangs of Mara — to embrace the tools of the enemy, so that those very tools might be turned back upon him.</div><div>Regardless of which road brought the new Nightmare to her Legacy, she is next made to enter into what may well be one of the greatest trials of her Awakened life. She submits herself to the “Nightmare Journey” spell (see below), with the deliberate intent of encountering one of the acamoth and immersing herself in the thoughts and dreams of that chthonic intelligence. Once there, the mage either learns to master the nightmare imaginings of those dread beings, or is consumed by them. Some willworkers’ bodies die with their faces contorted into expressions of purest fright, while others snap back to wakefulness, their minds shattered by the horrors they have witnessed. The Fangs lose about half of their prospective members that way, but the mages who survive with their sanity more or less intact are reborn, having harnessed the dreams of that which should not exist, and conquered fear thereby.</div><div>At each stage of growing understanding (as a Fang prepares to learn his next attainment), he again undergoes the “Nightmare Journey.” Some say that each sojourn is easier than the last, as the spirit becomes inured to the agonies of looking upon such unadulterated monstrosity. Others claim that each successive journey is more difficult than the previous one, as more and more of the entity’s attentions become focused upon a mind and spirit too small to easily weather such scrutiny. Still others find that the descent into the dreams of the unthinkable gets neither easier nor more difficult with time. It is, simply, what it is. Many Fangs prefer not to dwell overmuch on the subject, though. Some things are best kept locked away in the heart, even by mages who would learn to master horror from beyond space and time. </div>",

Dozens of students saw two of the world’s leading masters of Time casting vulgar magic against each other.</div><div>None of the mages survived, body or soul. Investigators from the Guardians of the Veil recovered the bodies. The Guardians could only obtain glimpses of how the mages died. The investigators found a massive surge of Paradox and one clear image: a member of the Past Masters being slain by — himself (!)— but the other self carried a large pocket watch with a death’s-head engraved on the cover. Behind them, the tattered edges of the world frayed into the Abyss.</div><div>Since then, mages who look like the deceased Mysterium mages and Seers have mounted attacks around the World of Darkness. They kill selected people (both mages and Sleepers), steal soulstones and Artifacts with powers of Time, Fate or Death, and destroy various objects, buildings and locations whose significance remains obscure. They cause a lot of Paradox in the process. Always, they carry the death’s-head watches. One mage who survived a clash with these murderous and destructive dopplegangers learned a name: the Cult of the Doomsday Clock.</div><div>Worried mages have learned little about the Cult. The doppleganger-mages routinely use magic to block attempts to scry on them after the fact. Mages of the orders soon found, however, that the Cult seeks new members from the Moros Path. What’s worse, the Cult sometimes locates newly-Awakened mages and brings them into its fold. In 2000, the Cult issued its first manifesto as part of a drive to attract new members. As the Legacy’s name suggests, the Cult wants to destroy the world. Not just to destroy civilization, or humanity; they want to destroy the Fallen World in toto, material realm and Shadow Realm alike. Only then, they say, can the souls of mages escape the vile prison that is Creation and ascend to the Supernal World.</div><div>No one can imagine how the Cult of the Doomsday Clock could actually annihilate the world. But no one could have imagined a Paradox eruption creating evil twins of the mages involved, either. The more the orders learn about this Legacy, however, the more certain they are that the Cult must be destroyed — for every clue about the Cult’s origins, masters and magic points straight to the Abyss.</div>",

Small numbers of mages from every order, however, have defected to the Cult.",

Some people despise the world just because they didn’t receive all the rewards they wanted. Such discontent can express itself through any Vice.

Members who possess the first attainment are called Hands. Foliots and Hands must obey higher-ranking members without question. The Cult does not like lower-ranking members to operate without supervision. A recruit who can hide her Cult membership may be asked to spy on her cabal, order and Consilium, but the Cult still insists that the recruit report to a superior every week or so. Most infiltrators are Foliots, since they lack the alterations to their souls that reveal Cult membership.</div><div>Cultists who reach the second attainment are called Tollers. The Cult trusts them to oversee missions and teach Hands and Foliots the Legacy’s magic of Time and destruction. Tollers also learn some of the Cult’s deeper mysteries and meet the Legacy’s true leaders. Nevertheless, Tollers, too, are watched and never go more than a month without meeting with the Cult’s senior members for thorough debriefings. Foliots and Hands may keep up the façade of mundane lives, but Tollers abandon such pretenses and devote their entire lives to the Cult.</div><div>After learning the third attainment, Cultists called Anachrons.

Always, a few mages and especially perceptive mortals have known the Fallen World was a prison for their souls. Buddhists rejecting the world, Jains starving unto death, the desert hermits and willing martyrs of early Christianity, Kabbalists who sought to see the throne of God — they all knew they did not belong in this world and were eager to leave it.</div><div>During all ages, mystics have tried to escape the Fallen World, but their attempts have all failed. After all, does anyone know a mage who actually, provably Ascended? No, the only solution is to destroy the prison. Burn it down from the inside! The souls of the Awakened will be purified and freed to return home.</div><div>During the late Hellenist period, mages associated with certain Gnostic cults believed that if they could study the flow of Time in the world with greater accuracy, they could find the flaws in Time and force them open, creating an escape route from the cosmic prison. These Gnostics studied the movements of the sun, moon and planets in search of gaps in Time. When mechanical clocks were invented in Europe, a new generation of mages used them to search for subtler flaws in Time. The mages found the flaws, and realized that the instruments used to measure time could control it — and destroy it. These mages became the founders of the Cult of the Doomsday Clock.</div><div>Sometimes, recruits hear that the Cult did not exist before 1997, and appeared in a massive Paradox manifestation. The recruits’ tutors compliment them on their perspicacity. The Exarchs, as the creators of Time in the Fallen World, try to erase the Cult from history — not just knowledge of the Doomsday Clock, but the members themselves, changing history so members never joined the Ticktock Men. The leaders of the Cult, however, wield enough power to protect themselves from these attempts. When the fabric of Time rips in massive Paradoxes, the Ticktock Men can return to history. They’ve done it before; some Anachrons have lived in two or three alternate histories before this world.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Penetrating the Mask</h4><div>Much of the Cult’s story does not jibe with what the orders teach about the origin and history of mages, and for a very good reason: the Cult’s story is a pack of lies. The doppleganger-mages who appeared on July 17, 1997, are not mages from an alternate history. They are creatures of the Abyss, literal Things From Beyond hiding in human form — and the mages they recruit become creatures like them.</div><div>Such abominations cannot be persuaded, tricked or tortured into giving away what they really are. They would rather die. They even think false thoughts for other mages to read. Only determined and powerful Mind magic can rip aside the mask of humanity (however twisted that humanity may be) to find the inhuman monster. Perceiving the true thoughts of a Doomsday Cult leader requires the Mind 4 spell “Read The Depths” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 215) which further must penetrate a Mind 3 “Mental Shield” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 208) with a Potency of 3. This special Mental Shield exists only to protect the false mage’s true inhuman thoughts but is active all the time, even when the mage is asleep or unconscious.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Humans don’t run the Cult of the Doomsday Clock. This is the Legacy’s deepest truth, and the truth the Cult most wants to hide. Even the most fanatical humans develop disagreements, get tired or make exceptions. The Anachrons don’t. They agree on everything. Their zeal never flags. They really, truly want to destroy the universe and will do or say anything to further that goal. Most of what a Doomsday Cult member learns is a lie designed to draw her further into the Cult.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Recruitment</h3><div>Just as any cult or radical group, the Doomsday Clock needs some way to attract new members. The Cult has two problems in this respect. First, the leaders of every order condemn the Doomsday Clock and want to destroy it. Second, the Cult’s doctrine is blatantly insane. </div><div>The first problem is simply an inconvenience. Consilium leaders and order luminaries tell other mages not to read the Doomsday Clock’s manifestos, but the leaders can’t stop anyone. If a mage really wants to spread a message to other mages, he can do it, and even maintain his own secrecy. Methods can range from broadsheets in Atlantean stapled on telephone poles to cockroaches programmed to type out messages by jumping around a keyboard. Many mages will read the manifesto just because they wonder what their seniors don’t want them to know.</div><div>The second problem is not as great for mages as for Sleepers. From personal experience, mages know the universe of common sense and Sleeper perception is a Great Lie. Annihilating the universe doesn’t seem quite as crazy when you know a whole other Supernal World exists. Some mages find the Fallen World distasteful enough, or the Supernal World alluring enough, that they can seriously consider destroying the one to reach the other. Ninety-nine out of 100 mages read a Doomsday Clock manifesto, think it’s claptrap and throw it away. The 100th mage — wonders.</div><div>Doomsday Clock manifestos lay out the basic doctrine that the Fallen World is a trap for mages’ souls. Mass Ascension requires annihilating the Fallen World. Without the ballast of matter and spirit dragging them down, souls can rise to the Supernal World and the Exarchs won’t be able to push them down again.</div><div>Mages who want to learn more can go to various web pages or mail-order tracts with material in both everyday languages and High Speech. Of course, everything is sanitized of sympathetic ties that could lead back to Cult members. A mage who finds this further information attractive can ask for a meeting with a Ticktock Man.</div><div>Cult leaders expect attempts to trap recruiters. Hands and Tollers covertly investigate mages who ask to meet the Cult, looking for evidence of treachery and to assess the mages’ characters. If the applicants seem sincerely interested, the Cult tells the mages to appear at a certain time and place — then visits them somewhere else, earlier, and whisks them away for active recruitment.</div><div>The Doomsday Clock uses standard cult techniques to mold the thoughts of candidates. Interested mages attend retreats in which they only associate with Foliots and Hands, all directed by a Toller. The Cultists drum in the message that the world is evil and only transcendence from it is good. The Cult has canned answers for most questions and doubts about its doctrine. Cultists never use magic on a candidate. The Cult’s leaders know that magical brainwashing can backfire, or leave traces that other mages can detect.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Trial Membership</h3><div>Candidates becomes Foliots when Cult officers decide the recruits sincerely want to join. Doomsday Clock recruits all start as Foliots, even if they have the Gnosis and Arcana to become Hands.</div><div>First, Tollers skilled at Mind magic examine the candidates’ thoughts in depth, searching for any hint of treachery. If applicants cannot trust the Cult in this, the Cult certainly has no reason to offer trust in return. The induction happens in one of the Cult’s minor sanctums. The recruits sign their true names on slip of papers while Hands snip off a lock of the recruits’ hair and draws an ounce of their blood into a small phial. The presiding Cultist (usually a Toller) places these three items inside a grandfather clock bearing symbols of the Arcana and Watchtowers.</div><div>The presiding Cultist tells the recruits they have sealed their destiny to the Doomsday Clock for all time. If they try to leave, or betray the Cult’s secrets, this Doomsday Clock shall toll the recruits’ final hours.</div><div>The clock at this ceremony is imbued with auras of Death, Fate and Time, but it doesn’t have any real powers; it just looks impressive. Later, an Anachron uses the sympathetic links to perform divinations about the new Foliot’s future loyalty, as another check against mindaltered spies and cowards who might turn on the Cult. The signature, blood and hair are also kept in case sympathetic magic becomes necessary in the future. Once a mage becomes a Foliot, her contacts in the Cult (never more than one Toller and three Hands) encourage her to draw back from other associations, both Sleeper and Awakened. The Cultists take the Foliot on more retreats, where she is further catechized in the Cult’s ideology. Her handlers teach her whatever Arcana and Skills she needs to qualify as a Hand and serve the Cult, from Science to Subterfuge. The Foliot also receives small missions as tests. Her handlers closely examine her performance. When the Foliot’s supervising Toller believes the Foliot knows the necessary Skills and Arcana, and has proven her loyalty, the Toller arranges for full induction into the Legacy. For the first time, the new member visits the Cult’s headquarters — the Clocktower.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Clocktower</h3><div>Individual Cultists may create their own sanctums, but the Cult itself has one special magical stronghold. The Tick tock Men call it the Clocktower. New members are told that the name pays homage to the Watchtowers. The Anachrons know the name is a challenge. Hands are told the Clocktower touches the Supernal World. Actually, the Clocktower exists in a pocket of space and time within the Abyss. The Clocktower is, indeed, a realm of its own, with powerful enchantments that Cultists may call upon, and it follows laws different from those of the material world or the  Shadow Realm.</div><div>From the Clocktower, a Cultist (or any mage with at least Time 4) can open a door to anywhere on Earth. This door is made of polished iron, carved with a clock face overlaying a large hourglass; the engraved hands of the clock visibly move. The door can appear in any wall where a normal door already exists. Only mages with Time senses can see the Clocktower’s door, though: the Clocktower and its doorways never exist in the now. They are always three seconds in the future. To pass through the door without assistance, a mage must possess the first attainment of the Cult, or use the Time 4 spell “Time Stutter” to jump at least three seconds ahead in time when he grasps the doorknob. Anyone who doesn’t meet these requirements steps through an ordinary door, to the ordinary place on the other side. Cultists call these doors Escapements, since the Cultists use them to get away after missions (or if missions go wrong). </div><div>Inside, the Clocktower is an Escher-like maze of impossible perspectives. Stairways form closed loops with no beginning or end. Every window looks out on another room or hallway of the Clocktower, possibly turned at right angles or upside-down. Angles are sometimes concave, sometimes convex. Everywhere, there are clocks or parts of clocks: wheels of numbers or digital readouts, swinging pendulums and pulsing springs, gears and escapements, sundials and hourglasses. Some clocks run too fast or too slow; some run backwards (even the hourglasses and water-clocks), or their hands move at random. </div><div>The Clocktower holds the Cult’s Library of magic lore, chambers where members can practice their spells, briefing rooms for planning missions and comparatively ordinary living quarters. One section holds a maze where the walls shift every few seconds. To traverse this maze, you need to know where the walls and open passages will be in the future; thus, only mages with temporal perceptions can solve this labyrinth. The center holds the Clocktower’s heart, the cathedral-like hall called the Aenigma Temporis. Time is deeply out of joint in the Aenigma Temporis, speeding, slowing and reversing without rhyme or reason. Here, the three Horae hold court, seated before the pendulum of an enormous clock with three randomly turning hands and a blank dial. The cabinet of the giant clock bears the ominous cliché, “It Is Always Later Than You Think.”</div><div>Every visitor can find his own image in the hall’s stained-glass windows. The windows shine as if there were a sunny day outside. Anyone who breaks a window, however, finds the dark horror of the Abyss on the other side.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Magic in the Clocktower</h3><div>In the Abyssal realm of the Clocktower, members of this Legacy gain a +2 bonus to all Time magic. Anyone else suffers a –2 penalty to spells and rotes using that Arcanum because of the warped flow of time. In the Aenigma Temporis, Anachrons and Horae receive the further advantage of a continuous Time 2 “Glimpsing the Future” effect (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 259), enabling them to roll twice for one instant action every turn, and take the better of the two rolls.</div><div>All magical senses are “whited out” in the Aenigma Temporis. The mystical forces are too disrupted by the Paradox of the place’s own existence to reveal anything else. Anachrons and Horae are immune to this effect.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Operations</h3><div>As specialists in Time, the Cultists of the Doomsday Clock plans for the future. Many of the Cult’s operations are designed to forestall or create some future possibility that sends the Fallen World closer to the Abyss.</div><div>Every eruption of Paradox frays the fabric of reality a little more, so Doomsday Clock members don’t worry much about causing Paradox. This necessarily means a greater likelihood of branding. For Cultists, branding usually has a clock or temporal theme, ranging from part of the body looking incongruously aged (or young) to a limb transforming into still-living structure of jointed metal and clockwork. </div><div>Sometimes the Cult works stealthily to acquire lore and magic that may help in future acts of destruction. The Cult especially seeks soulstones and Artifacts. Soulstones let the Cult enslave other mages as thralls and are used to build Demesnes. Artifacts charged with Death, Time or Prime may provide clues to unmaking reality. The Cult also seeks mystic lore as assiduously as any other magical group, in hopes of finding ways to wreak destruction more completely and on a vaster scale. </div><div>Quite often, though, the Cult must act openly and violently. For instance, acquiring soulstones usually means attacking the mages who created a Demesne. Ticktock Men also attack cabals to loot their Libraries of any Artifacts they possess.</div><div>The Sleeper world comes in for attack as well. At least once a year, the Cult murders a Sleeper for no apparent reason — at least, no reason the Sleepers can see. The orders feel sure the Cult kills Sleepers who could oppose its plans in the future. For instance, a child destined to become a great diplomatic peacemaker could put a crimp in the Cult’s plans for mass destruction. A murder or the destruction of a building might also change another person’s destiny, making him more likely to become angry, despairing or otherwise more likely to choose a path that brings destruction to the world.</div><div>Finally, some atrocities are tests and training. Mass destruction — or even universal destruction — may sound easy in the abstract, but a person who thinks she’s a hardened badass or resolute idealist might choke when asked to bomb a crowd or cut a child’s throat. The Cult gradually leads recruits to more brutal and ruthless deeds. No Cultist becomes a Toller without committing coldblooded murders and other sickening atrocities. Not only can such people never leave the Ticktock Men without admitting their guilt to themselves, such vile deeds lower a mage’s Wisdom and, therefore, make Paradox eruptions last longer, for a more severe erosion of reality.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Doomsday Clocks</h3><div>The Cult’s name is more than just a poetic figure of speech or a reference to their pocket watches. The Anachrons build actual Doomsday Clocks. These magical devices destroy an area. Fire or bombs seem destructive enough to Sleepers. But, to the Cult, such destructive devices merely change the form of matter. The Cult wants complete annihilation — a bit of reality gone forever.</div><div>Each Doomsday Clock works only once and is difficult to produce, so the Cult cannot use these infernal devices as often as the Cultists would like. Some Doomsday Clocks destroy material objects; other Doomsday Clocks kill the living or disrupt ephemera. The Cult’s ultimate goal is to build a Doomsday Clock powerful enough to unmake the entire Fallen World. No mage can imagine how they might do this — but no mage who has seen the effect from a little Doomsday Clock can say it’s categorically impossible. This, above all, explains the fear the Cult inspires.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Sample Doomsday Clock (Imbued Item ••••••)</h4><div>Durability 3, Size 2, Structure 5</div><div><b>Mana:</b> 12</div><div>A Doomsday Clock looks like an old-fashioned clock, small enough to fit into an attaché case. The Clock’s case is made of polished black iron with lead trim. Instead of numbers, however, the Clock’s dial carries cryptic sigils known only through studies of the Abyss.</div><div>This particular Doomsday Clock destroys every object made of normal matter within 32 yards. The Clock does not destroy “extraordinary matter” such as enchanted items, supernatural materials such as thaumium or matter that carries an extra “charge” of meaning, such as gold or diamonds. Sometimes that isn’t a bug, it’s a feature: Cultists can disintegrate a sanctum with the assurance that any Artifacts, soulstones and other magical objects will remain undamaged — and easy to loot.</div><div>The Clock carries two spells that “fire” at once. The first consists of the Matter effect, “Annihilate Matter” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 201) raised to Matter 5 for a combined spell; this also lets it affect an area. The Clock combines this with a Time 4 effect, “Erase History” (described below). Nothing destroyed by the Clock can be scried later using Time 2 “Postcognition” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 260) or other spells to look back in time. That means anything destroyed by the Clock is truly gone forever, with no chance that a mage could look back in time and re-create it — true, total annihilation. Doomsday Clocks raise this effect to Time 5 for a combined spell, area effect and advanced prolongation (to erase a destroyed object’s temporal traces back to its origin). The spells require lots of successes to annihilate large areas — but the Cult includes several masters of each requisite Arcanum, and they use every trick to ease the accumulation of successes in an extended casting.</div><div>Each round, the Clock expends one Mana and projects the combined spells over its area. As damage accumulates from repeated uses of “Annihilate Matter,” first small objects disappear, then large objects, walls and even the ground underneath. At the same time, “Erase History” renders everything in the area impossible to see through temporal magic, reaching back through time: a few minutes before the clock struck, an hour, a day.... If the Doomsday Clock tolls enough times, the area’s entire history becomes impossible to scry. After expending the last point of Mana, the Clock itself disintegrates. Once the Clock strikes, the only way to stop it is to destroy it. Because the Doomsday Clock works only once, its cost is reduced by one dot.</div><div>No one but the Anachrons and Horae know how to build the Doomsday Clocks. It cannot be easy, because the Cult does not use the enchanted clocks very often.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Horae</h3><div>These powerful Abyssal entities created the Clocktower and sent the doppleganger-mage Anachrons into the world. The Horae cannot enter the Fallen World themselves, so characters are not likely to encounter them anywhere but the Clocktower. </div><div>Horae look like black, hooded monastic robes draped over unseen figures. Two gearwheels spin where eyes should be, and hands of jointed brass emerge from the sleeves. The Horae wield powers of Time and Death comparable to master mages. The Horae have other vast powers, too — they apparently created the Clocktower — but, in a direct confrontation, they use Numina that duplicate Time and Death rotes.</div><div><b>Rank:</b> 4</div><div><b>Attributes:</b> Power 10, Finesse 10, Resistance 10 Willpower: 20</div><div><b>Essence:</b> 25 (25 max)</div><div><b>Initiative:</b> 20</div><div><b>Defense:</b> 10</div><div><b>Speed:</b> 25</div><div><b>Size:</b> 5</div><div><b>Corpus:</b> 15</div><div><b>Influence:</b> Death 5, Time 5</div><div><b>Numina:</b> Horae can duplicate any rote based on Death or Time. For instance, an Hora might attack using a ranged version of the Death 4 spell “Rotting Flesh.”</div><div><b>Ban:</b> Horae cannot maintain their quasi-physical form outside the Clocktower. If one of these creatures is forced into the Fallen World, the Hora tears apart and vanishes, leaving a Timebased Paradox anomaly. If forced into the Abyss, an Hora expands into a huge, menacing phantom and vanishes, but reappears in the Clocktower a scene later. If all three Horae are destroyed, the Clocktower crumbles within minutes.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Initiation to the Legacy itself comes once a Foliot meets the requirements for the first attainment and has proven his loyalty through some deadly betrayal of former colleagues. An Anachron brings the candidate to the Clocktower. The candidate proves his readiness by negotiating the maze to the Aenigma Temporis. In that zone of twisted time, the candidate’s own future self helps the mage craft his soul to achieve the first attainment. At least, that’s what it looks like to the candidate. Any Anachron or Toller can guide the soulcrafting; the Cult uses an illusion of the candidate’s older, future self as another stratagem to convince the Cultist he can never leave — because, apparently, he hasn’t. Or maybe it’s no illusion at all. In the Aenigma Temporis, it’s impossible to tell. The experience points normally tithed to the tutor pass to the Horae instead, so it doesn’t matter who actually initiates the new Hand. The initiate receives his death’s-head pocket watch and becomes a field agent for the Cult.</div><div>A Doomsday Clock cultist receives the second attainment in the material world, outside the Clocktower. The nascent Toller repeatedly invokes “Shifting Sands” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 263), replaying the same moments but acting differently each time, until she causes a Paradox. Instead of quelling the Paradox, the new Toller must embrace it. As reality twists and tears, the mages forces her soul to twist and tear along with it, further separating the Cultist from the natural flow of Time. After the ceremony, the Toller visits the Clocktower and meets the Horae.</div><div>Despite what the Cult teaches, Foliots, Hands or Tollers can leave the Cult — if they don’t mind being hunted by a group of mages with Intimate sympathetic links to them, and able to see the future. Not so after the third attainment. This ceremony takes place in the Aenigma Temporis. The Horae guide the nascent Anachron in scrying his own past, right back to his Awakening — and then he attacks and kills his past self, making his very existence a Paradox. Once again, maybe this is just an illusion, or maybe it’s not. At the moment when the Cultist invokes his own nonexistence, the Horae finish his soul’s transformation. The new Anachron does not simply possess a new attainment. The person he was has truly ceased to be. He is a creature of the Abyss, dedicated to Oblivion forevermore.</div>",

The Cultists see this as a sign of their greater liberation from the restrictions set by the Exarchs. When the Fallen World is destroyed, all souls shall dwell in Eternity. A Cultist’s warped soul and mutilated connection to Time marks her, however, as tainted by the chaos of the Abyss. Mages with chronal senses can feel the way Time frays around a Doomsday Clock Cultist; and even if the mage doesn’t recognize this as a sign of the infamous Cult, any sensible mage sees the danger from this weakening of reality. The Cult grows because not all mages are sensible.",

        "firstAttainmentDescription": "<div>At first, a Ticktock Man can disrupt Time only in small ways. When a Cultist wants, she can make time shiver and swirl around her. She, and objects in her immediate vicinity, speed up and slow down from moment to moment, and even seem to move backwards for fractions of a second. One part of the Cultist may be accelerated while another part of her body slows. This makes the Cultist more difficult to hit and reduces the force of any attack that succeeds. The result is exactly like the Time 2 rote, “Temporal Dodge” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 261). The Cultist gains one point of armor per dot she possesses in the Time Arcanum.</div><div>Time Out of Joint is not a covert effect, though: the mage’s herky-jerky movement looks deeply wrong. Even Sleepers can see this (though they usually Disbelieve what they see).</div><div>Doomsday Clock initiates also possess an innate sense for the passage and manipulation of time, such as the Time 1 rote, “Temporal Eddies” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 258) — but only for an internal clock and to register the use of other Time-based magic (including the Cult’s own attainments).

        "secondAttainmentDescription": "<div>Tollers gain the power to disrupt time and history enough to double back on their own timelines. When a Toller wants, he can jump back a few seconds and live them over again, but make different choices and perform different actions. This attainment mimics the Time 3 effect, “Shifting Sands,” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 263) except Bid Time Return does not require any sort of dice roll. Undoing history still costs the Cultist a point of Mana, though.</div><div>Bid Time Return makes Ticktock Men into incredible tacticians. A Toller can try one course of action, then jump back and try again if his first choice was wrong — so long as he lives, and still has Mana to spend. For example, a Toller could take a turn out of combat to wedge a door shut, right before his enemy’s reinforcements were about to run through it. The moment the reinforcements burst in, the Cultist realized blocking the door mattered more than launching his last attack, so he rewound the last turn and did that instead. Bid Time Return doesn’t guarantee victory, for the new choice may bring consequences of its own. In this example, the Toller gives his opponent a chance to attack him without a response; his actions to block the door might even make him easier to hit.</div>",

Off the Clock resembles the Time 4 rote, “Seven Breaths in an Instant” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 265), even to using the successes from a Wits + Occult + Time roll to set the ratio between external time and the Anachron’s personal time. A Ticktock Man can also make time run more slowly for her, however, so an hour can seem to pass her by in minutes. For instance, with three successes, a Cultist could spend one hour Off the Clock while 15 minutes pass in the wider world, or spend 15 minutes Off the Clock while the rest of the world sees an hour pass.</div><table border='1' style='margin: 15px 0;'><thead><tr><th style='padding: 5px;'>Time within Pocket</th><th style='padding: 5px;'>Target Number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='padding: 5px;'>x2( faster or slower)</td><td style='padding: 5px;'>1 success</td></tr><tr><td style='padding: 5px;'>x3</td><td style='padding: 5px;'>2 successes</td></tr><tr><td style='padding: 5px;'>x4</td><td style='padding: 5px;'>3 successes</td></tr><tr><td style='padding: 5px;'>x5</td><td style='padding: 5px;'>4 successes</td></tr><tr><td style='padding: 5px;'>x6</td><td style='padding: 5px;'>5 successes</td></tr></tbody></table><div>Anachrons can use Off the Clock to rest, recuperate or prepare ritual spells. This attainment makes a useful escape route, too: a mage in a temporal pocket can only be affected by other mages with Time magic. </div><div>Anachrons use Off the Clock to infiltrate locations that are guarded only some of the time. For instance, a Ticktock Man who wants to spend a few hours in a heavily guarded museum’s archives could enter during the public hours, slip Off the Clock, then re-enter normal time after the museum closes and is locked up tight. When he finishes his research, he goes Off the Clock again until the museum opens, then walks out with other visitors.</div><div>The Cultist’s mutilated soul also becomes a slave to the Abyss, an inhuman horror that merely wears the mage’s body and mind as a disguise. In the unlikely event that a mage waited until Gnosis 8 to craft her soul without the help of an Anachron or the Horae, she would avoid this fate.</div>",

        "descrizione": "<div>The Dreamspeakers are eternal, but as new as the last dawn — an enduring Legacy that the socalled Primals say calls certain souls. That is why it exists in all times and places, adapting to the signs and legends of every society. Ironically, this has not given Legacy members a common purpose. In fact, they are some of the most fractious mages alive because they are devoted to their kin and community over other mages — including other Dreamspeakers.</div><div>The idea that magic is primarily a secret, intellectual practice is foreign to the mindset of the Legacy. Sleepers have known Primals for what they are ever since the first of them learned to communicate with the Dream. Dreamspeakers claim to have been the first mages and, among all others, closest to the original purpose of the Awakened. Other mages call the Dream “Astral Space,” and describe it as a place entirely separate from the rest of the universe: a kingdom of souls where powerful men and women can erect their own temples of fancy. Dreamspeakers believe this is an arrogant, ignorant and dangerous worldview.</div><div>According to the Legacy, the whole Dream was once an intrinsic part of human existence. Hunters couldn’t kill their prey unless they knew its place in the Dream, and to learn anything, a respectful person needed to walk the Dream until they found a place where that lore played itself out in living myths. Most importantly, the Dream’s inhabitants were the creators and rulers of the world. Long ago, they walked the physical world, living out epics that the Dreamspeakers preserve through their oral teachings. After a time, the Dreamborn grew bored or tired with creation. They retreated to the deep Dreamtime where they were born.</div><div>Mysterium anthropologists have their own theories about the Dreamspeakers, but Primals pay those mages little heed. Drawing from Sleeper theories, mystagogues believe that a Dreamspeaker learns to communicate with the deepest parts of her own consciousness. These regions are inextricably linked with the Astral Plane, extending beyond personal dreamscapes into the primordial symbols of human consciousness. Mystagogues believe that Dreamspeakers learn to extend the Awakening into the so-called primitive regions of the brain,  such as the limbic system, Dreamspeakers find this unlikely because, to the Dream existed before humanity. Human dreams reflect the Astral Dream, not the other way around.</div><div>Dreamspeakers believe that the potential to join their Legacy is almost always innate. Men or women with the fire of the Dream must join the Legacy or live in madness, unable to understand why they are plagued by visions and voices. Although some mages risk their sanity to open this potential within their souls, this is not seen as a particularly laudable thing. After all, every Dreamspeaker has a purpose outside of his own enlightenment.</div><div>Self-discovery isn’t the point. Instead, a Dreamspeaker is conscious of a side of the universe that few people know of, and is obligated to act as a mediator between the Dream and the physical world. He teaches his people about the Dream, and they, in turn, ask him to represent them there. Legacy members rarely accept anyone who is unwilling to meet this obligation. In the past, they almost never accepted anyone who wasn’t already destined to join them, but in the modern age, many Dreamspeakers have realized that they belong to a broader cultural movement that’s in danger of being swept away by modern, materialistic values. That’s why the Legacy has opened itself to initiates from the Free Council.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Dreamspeaker Shamanism</h3><div>Dreamspeaking is not the only form of shamanism, and the Dreamspeakers know this. Primals believe that the term “shaman” denotes an arbitrary grouping of mages with little in common besides a place apart from the world’s monolithic religious institutions. A few respect the term as far as it applies to anthropology, or as a description of the Thyrsus Path. In the latter context, Dreamspeakers know that many shamans focus on the Shadow Realm. Such mages believe that it represents the truth of a living universe, where every object has a corresponding spirit. Dreamspeakers agree that the world is alive and full of the diverse children of the Dreamborn, but hold that the Dreamborn themselves – not their raucous, competitive offspring – are the world’s wisdom keepers. </div><div>Consequently, while Dreamspeakers are fully conversant in the Spirit Arcanum and the lore of the Shadow, they cultivate a strictly utilitarian relationship with Shadow spirits. These spirits deserve respect, but not worship. Even though Shadow beings hold the essence of this world, they are locked into the roles that the Dreamborn made for them. But only the Dreamborn know why the universe is ordered as it is. Dreamspeakers respect the Dreamborn for this secret lore. Other shamanic ways are useful, but not as profound.</div><div>Dreamspeakers have few traditions in common, but one is that their Legacy is almost always the predestined vocation for a few, special individuals. People chosen by the Dream experience what the uninitiated might call a psychological breakdown. Future Dreamspeakers suffer “delusions” (actually secret knowledge) and “hallucinations” (visions of the Dream). A Legacy tutor teaches initiates to understand their experiences and use them as magical aids. Without a tutor, an initiate’s life usually falls apart, though there are rare stories about the Dreamborn themselves initiating mages.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Dreamborn</h3><div>The question of whether the Dreamborn have always existed, created themselves or are the offspring of an even more powerful order of beings is answered differently by the various Dreamspeaker groups. When Dreamspeakers from different cultures meet, they don’t consider the question to be very important. Instead, encountering the Dreamborn in the here and now, and searching for the signs they left within the world form a shared focus. The nature of the dreamborn isn’t really fit for cold analysis. They simply are, and by human reckoning, always have been the true parents of Creation.</div><div>The original Dreamborn dreamed the universe into existence in story cycles and poetry. When their task was complete, they withdrew into their own realms. In the Fallen age, they might be slumbering even more deeply than when they dreamed the world. Alternately, they may have “awakened” into a place where no shaman can go. There, beyond the deepest Dreamtime, they might be gathering the power to remake — or destroy — all the realms. Dreamspeakers versed in Atlantean traditions believe that the Supernal Realms are these deep dreams or forbidden places. Spells call the Dreamborn into the world to unleash their creative powers. Dreamborn breathe, eat and excrete power, and have no more control over where it all goes than a person can command the location of every stray hair or footprint. This is why ignorant mages can steal some of this power, using it without honoring its source.</div><div>In legends, a few humans have become Dreamborn. The first man and woman are almost always thought to be among these legendary. So are powerful Dreamspeakers and heroes. The first person to make fire was probably one of the Dreamborn. Although great deeds vault a person into the ranks of the Dreamborn, these heroes are never envied. According to myth, most of them lived anguished lives. Elder Dreamborn hated those brave (or arrogant) enough to steal divine powers. Fire and the secrets of healing plants were holy secrets until ancient heroes uncovered them. These heroes won divinity inside the Dream, but not before suffering the wrath of the Dreamborn that made the world.</div><div>It’s also common for Dreamspeakers to become minor Dreamborn. These deified shamans watch over their own Lineages. A few modern Dreamspeakers also claim they’ve met historical figures in the deepest Dreamtime. These phantoms are common enough in the astral shallows, but finding them in the depths proves that they’ve become one with the great archetypes of Dream. Whether or not people such as Albert Einstein or Mao Zedong still live as Dreamborn is a controversial topic.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Primals",
        "orders": "Dreamspeakers are mostly indifferent to the orders, and for the most part, the orders return the favor. Only the Free Council fully accepts the Legacy. Free Council mages are intrigued by the Dreamspeakers’ claim to ancient, truly universal human magic. The order rarely demands anything from its Dreamspeaker members, leaving them to follow their own Paths and work within the communities they prefer. Some Libertines almost venerate the Legacy as free spirits who have never truly submitted to the Atlantean ideology. To these Libertines, the Dreamspeakers represent an unconquered, enduring magical tradition.<div>The Primals have always resisted the Lie, and in return, they have borne the brunt of oppression from urban religious movements and colonization. Libertines come into the Legacy looking for the “original magic,” or to experience cultures they feel haven’t been as tainted by colonizers and conquerors. Free Council Mastigos often join the Dreamspeakers to better explore their own, traumatic Awakenings. Some Mastigos slide right from the terror of the Mastigos Mystery Play to the Dreamspeaker initiation, suffering utter madness until they find the Dream. </div><div>Adamantine Arrows often find the Dream. The Primal way is filled with tales of violence, blood and magical oaths. Arrow Dreamspeakers channel warrior myths into reality, calling Dreamborn to possess them and drive them to excellence. As skilled healers, Dreamspeakers also provide support for Arrow war bands. Dreamspeakers who combine their unique skills with more straightforward martial abilities can quickly rise to the top of the order’s political structure. These elder mages create warrior societies with their own rituals. A Primal usually inducts mages and Sleepers into such groups without prejudice. The Primal calling drives him to find members from outside Awakened society. If he is a warrior, then he’s compelled to teach a warrior’s lessons to all who require them. </div><div>A Guardian of the Veil who hears the Dream’s call might suffer a crisis of faith. Guardians hide magic from Sleepers, but Dreamspeakers share magic. They counsel their communities about the role of the Dreamborn in their lives. Reconciling this duty with the Guardians’ ethos requires careful judgment. Primals know that some secrets should stay buried, but not to the point of leaving Sleepers too ignorant to live in peace with them. As a compromise, Dreamspeakers can induct their communities into the Guardians’ Labyrinth (see Guardians of the Veil and Mage: The Awakening, p. 46). Such Dreamspeakers teach their own tribes and families special initiation rites. These Dreamspeakers teach their followers to respect the Dream without revealing its most dangerous secrets.</div><div>Dreamspeakers have a chaotic relationship with the Mysterium. On one hand, the order respects enduring traditions, but there’s a fine line between knowing the ancient ways and stealing from them. Many Dreamspeakers hail from cultures that have had their fill of priests, government officials and social scientists taking their artifacts and teachings. Nevertheless, Dreamspeakers are devoted to secret knowledge, too. A skilled Primal needs to know all the names and signs the Dream leaves in the world. Mystagogues who find their calling within the Legacy don’t compromise their own ways of knowing for the sake of conventional academic biases. This turns out to be extraordinarily useful. Once freed of these conventions, the Primal can interpret evidence in ways her colleagues might never consider.</div><div>The Legacy’s relationship with the Silver Ladder is an odd case. No other order suits the Primals’ social roles better, but the théarchs are obsessed with Atlantis — a place Primals consider to be little more than a waypoint in the Dream. Still, there are those who believe that the Dream must come back to an Awakened Nation. The Dreamspeakers never rejected Atlantis, but when it fell, it became another teaching tale. For this reason, Dreamspeaker théarchs are powerful community leaders who are especially devoted to social cohesion and moral lessons. If the Awakened Nation is to rise again, it mustn’t turn into another tale of fools and power.</div><div>Finally, it should be noted that there are Dreamspeakers who are not a part of any order. These apostates hold to no higher organization than their own community. They respect their initiation Lineage and no other. As medicine workers for their people, they believe that the grandiose politics of the Awakened world are distractions. Some Dreamspeakers even believe that outsiders pollute the Dream and should not practice magic at all. </div>",
        "appearance": "Dreamspeakers prefer a practical style that favors their own cultural affiliations and personal Dreams. The stereotypical Primal has initiatory scars or tattoos, but these are merely symbols of his social ties. The Dreamspeaker values these, but not as much as the invisible mark of his calling. Still, the power of the Dream can leave many outward signs. Personal taboos can change a Dreamspeaker’s body language and speech; he might avoid walking in a straight line or will never directly name a thing that figures strongly in his Dream.<div>Dreamspeakers often feel called to manipulate their gender identities by cross-dressing or affecting an androgynous style. A Dreamspeaker who is a skilled Life mage might use magic to change her sex. Because Dreamspeakers unlock the secrets of their own psyches, most learn to accept elements of their sexuality others might deny or ignore. Among other things, this means that Primals may play with gender as a form of magical symbolism, as a means of expressing their own sexual identities or both.</div>",
        "background": "Dreamspeakers claim to represent the most primal tradition of magic. It existed before Atlantis and unless the Lie utterly crushes the human spirit, will survive after every other Legacy dies. The calling has always existed, but initiates must decide whether they are crazy or ready for the Dream.<div>This Legacy is less of a discipline than a calling. Most mages become Dreamspeakers because they feel as if they have no choice in the matter. They suffer what might be called a spiritual crisis, a psychotic break or both. Primals believe that it’s a choice between initiation and madness. As such, members can come from virtually any background. Nevertheless, mages familiar with cultures that revere spiritual healing are more likely to find tutors.</div><div>Initiates who belong to such a traditional culture are among the most sincere guardians of their community’s political autonomy and religious customs. After they experience the first throes of Awakening and “madness,” their tutors tell them deep secrets. These include creation myths unknown to the uninitiated, the names and characteristics of the Dreamborn, and oral histories that include tales of hidden times and places. Outsiders who hear these stories might find Atlantis in the words and signs — but then again, they might not.</div><div>Outside of these communities, Dreamspeakers’ backgrounds are often irrelevant to their current concerns. A successful lawyer Awakens. His Art leads to a string of legal victories — until the Dream calls. He abandons his successful practice for the wilderness 100 miles away from his office. A young woman’s parents treat the Dream as if it were an illness. They institutionalize her, dimming the Dream with drugs until a tutor discovers her potential. </div>",
        "organizzation": "Communities determine how Dreamspeakers organize. A Primal learns the cultural signs of a community from his tutor, establishing a Lineage of common beliefs and practices. Dreamspeakers who share a tradition band together into medicine societies. These groups share secret signs. When members of a Dreamspeaker community encounter an unfamiliar mage, they subtly determine whether or not the outsider knows them. If she does, she is a possible ally, but if she doesn’t, she might be a threat to the community. Dreamspeakers often shun or ward against these mages, even if the outsiders are other Dreamspeakers.<div>Still, there is a growing movement among Dreamspeakers from different backgrounds to ally based on their common values. This movement is a few centuries old; roughly half of the Legacy ascribes to it. The other half either is split between those who believe that they should integrate with the Pentacle orders and those or who isolate themselves from outsiders completely. Isolationists are not always xenophobes, but believe that they must stand apart to preserve the purity of their traditions. It’s a serious concern, because other mages have used medicine society secrets to pose as allies of a community. The problem has a parallel among Sleepers, where “White Shamans” profit from indigenous beliefs without giving anything back. Mages who infiltrate Dreamspeaker communities with similar strategies have been known to abuse the secrets of the Dreaming for their own benefit.</div>",
        "suggestedOblations": "Drumming or listening to drums and other rhythmic instruments. Dancing. Physical ordeals, such as suspension and controlled strangulation. Isolation in a sacred place.<div>Dreamspeakers also use specialized drugs. Anthropologists call these natural preparations entheogens (derived from the Greek for “god within”). The scientific community has only begun to categorize these drugs, since many of them are prepared from exotic plants. Medically, they are usually categorized as hallucinogens, even though the Dreamspeakers who use these drugs would not characterize states induced as unreal. In contemporary urban environments, Dreamspeakers make use of a number of more common legal and illegal drugs.</div>",
        "concepts": "Fringe anthropologist, psychologist, charismatic preacher, tribal healer, ecstatic oracle.",
        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>The Dreamspeakers have no founder and no common history. Instead, each tutor/initiate Lineage has stories that tell the Dreamspeakers why they have entered the Dream, where it will take them and what their responsibilities are. Some legends even say that the very first humans were Dreamspeakers. These humans understood their place in the Dream and talked to its denizens without the need for special rituals.</div><div>This is not to say that the Dreamspeakers know nothing about Atlantis. Thousands of legends talk about the Awakened Nation and the hubris that destroyed it. Dreamspeakers say that they existed before Atlantis and despite their indifference to the place, led the first mages there. Their stories describe the rise of new sorcerers, each of whom held to some new, grandiose philosophy. Their ambitions exceeded the bounds of their own communities, so they warred with each other and with members of the Legacy. Dreamspeakers defended their communities ably until the Dream itself signaled a change. </div><div>The “dragons” that led the way to Atlantis were Dreamborn. Sorcerers outside of the Legacy couldn’t understand their visions, but the Dreamspeakers could. Primals cemented the first alliance between the Legacy and outsiders because Primals divined the will and path of the Dreamborn. This assured the Dreamspeakers a distinct place in Atlantean society. A shadow of this role existed in later cultures. Japanese miko and the Delphic Oracle recall the role of Dreamspeakers in Atlantis. They relayed the Dream to priests and sorcerers who had lost touch with its primal nature. </div><div>In time, the lords of Atlantis forgot why they enshrined the Dreamspeakers. Primals relayed the warnings of the Dream without success, because the populace believed that the Dreamspeakers’ utterances were nothing more than a ritual for the mad. When the Dream made it clear that Atlantis would fall and the people wouldn’t listen, the Legacy abandoned the city.</div><div>Atlantis fell; the Dreamspeakers returned to smaller communities. They never rejected civilization, but did not think urban cultures were necessarily superior. Whenever they followed their people to lives in a city or nation, they found that these places repeated the folly of Atlantis. Once the people embraced abstract philosophies and distant gods, they stopped listening to the Dream. </div><div>This is why the Legacy’s oldest Lineages exist among tribal communities. Such cultures never lost sight of the Dream. On the other hand, Dreamspeakers still dwell in the middle of urban life. The Dream calls to people no matter where they live. Isolated from the roots of Dreamspeaker cultural practices, these initiates justify their experiences within mainstream religions. Dreamspeakers find their way into Christian congregations and Buddhist temples. According to legend, a few Legacy mages can’t trace their initiation back to a mortal tutor, leading some to speculate that ancestor spirits or even the Dream itself taught them. Modern Primals sometimes claim they were Dream-initiated in order to demand respect from their fellows, but to put it diplomatically, this is usually only true “from a certain point of view.”</div><div>Unfortunately, the Legacy’s universality contributed to a widening gulf between medicine workers who lived in small traditional communities and those who adopted burgeoning empires. Colonial civilization suppressed the eldest Dreamspeaker lines by destroying their cultures. Ironically, “civilized” Dreamspeakers were sometimes at the forefront of conversion and destruction efforts. In North America, aboriginal medicine workers and zealous Christian evangelists were the two most common pastimes of Dreamspeakers. To this day, elder medicine societies will rarely admit that they share a Legacy with the evangelists. The exceptions see organized religions as a place to divert would-be “White Shamans,” so they can follow the Dream without stealing traditional lore.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2></div><div>Dreamspeakers are cautious around outsiders. Most Dreamspeakers follow cultural traditions that warn them of the black magic and evil practices of foreign mages. Furthermore, Primals have seen that it is their fate to be marginalized within ambitious, expansionist cultures. This makes them reluctant to participate in modern Awakened society. On the other hand, the Legacy is not mired in the past, and individual members do join conventional cabals. </div><div>Most Primals assess outsiders based on how they treat the local community. Mages who harm and manipulate a Dreamspeaker’s people are enemies to be driven off and killed. In this respect, the Legacy has no patience for Consilium dictates or the supposedly universal Lex Magica. A single incident can earn the longstanding enmity of a Dreamspeaker band. </div><div>On the other hand, not all Dreamspeakers are benign healers and counselors. A few prefer a more ambiguous role. Their charges know that they can harm or heal. Fearful communities learn to shower these Primals with gifts to avoid sickness and disasters. The Legacy sees no common ground between peaceful and threatening members; they kill and confound each other almost as often as they do outsiders.</div><div>One of the most distinctive aspects of the Legacy is the way they skirt customs that require them to hide the Mysteries.</div><div>A dreamspeaker’s people usually know that he can perform miracle. This is, after all his purpose — the very reason the community supports him. This is the primary reason why so few Dreamspeakers join the Guardians of the Veil. However, Dreamspeakers almost never practice obvious magic in front of Sleepers. Dreamspeakers know that witnesses not only offend the Dream, but risk their own sanity when they see its uncloaked power.</div><div>A Dreamspeaker’s community is so central to her existence that it bears some additional discussion. In most cases, the community has been served by Legacy members for as long the community has existed. There are specific rules within the society that govern how members treat the Dreamspeaker, including protocols of address, marriage (some communities give the Dreamspeaker preferential treatment; others forbid it) and who may succeed her.</div><div>Dreamspeakers can join the Legacy without finding a community to support them. In such cases, the Primal reaches out to find people who accept him, as there seems to be an instinctual need to become a part of a community. Some conservative societies may view him as a raving heretic; others accept his eccentric, influential presence. In the last century, it’s often been the case that new Dreamspeakers choose a place in Awakened society, adopting a Consilium as their own community. Even so, a Dreamspeaker serves in his own way, and doesn’t feel especially bound by political concerns.</div><div>It begins in anguish. The initiate suffers a mental breakdown characterized by hallucinations and extreme emotions. Most mages have already experienced an event like this during their Awakening, but for a potential Dreamspeaker, the breakdown runs even deeper. Other mages learn to accept and absorb the mad spark of Awakening. Dreamspeakers do not; the visions, symbols and strange encounters never stop for long. If a potential Dreamspeaker sees this as a disease, he may look to psychiatry and drugs, but they won’t help. If he doesn’t seek initiation, he may spiral into drug addiction, institutionalization or suicide. Some even accept that Awakening is a disease. They become Banishers.</div><div>More experienced mages can also suffer a Dreamspeaker’s spiritual crisis. The crisis may take the form of persistent Paradoxes, derangements or traumatic Astral journeys. If they can find initiation, they learn to accept these afflictions as parts of the Dream. Indeed, they may turn these experiences into lessons that strengthen the rest of their lives.</div><div>Finally, sometimes mages with stable psyches want to become Dreamspeakers. Such mages often believe that the Mysteries are overly intellectual, or have been obscured by politics and unnecessary rituals. Many Free Council members join the Legacy to sever all of their ties with the politics and myths of magic. They crave direct experience over study. They get what they wish for, but it doesn’t come without a price. This form of initiation is the hardest of all, because the initiate’s tutor must force open the gates of the Dream. This process can require physical ordeals, psychoactive drugs and extended Astral journeys.</div><div>A Dreamspeaker tutor is capable of distinguishing between mere madness and the call of the Dream. Sifting through visions and dreams, he discovers whether or not the initiate’s distress is caused by her own mind or messages from the Dreamborn. If a tutor finds signs of the Dreamborn in a prospective initiate’s thoughts, he knows that she’s been chosen.</div><div>The tutor intuitively compares these signs to his own initiation. During the last century, with so many Dreamspeaker communities recovering from colonial crimes, tutors sometimes found it necessary to search slums and hospitals for initiates. Traditional wisdom is in such short supply that many potential Dreamspeakers never identify the true source of their anguish. Tutors sometimes find it necessary to cure their charges of drug addictions, spring them from prisons and psychiatric hospitals, or extricating them from dangerous associations with drug dealers and abusive family members.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Who Is a Dreamspeaker?</h3></div><div>All Dreamspeakers suffer psychological trauma as part of their initiation, but this doesn’t mean that the Storyteller should inflict a nervous breakdown upon a character to force him into this Legacy. Joining the Legacy is not necessarily the character’s choice, but it is always the player’s choice. This means that the player and Storyteller should work out the details of the initiation. Storytellers should indicate whether or not they’ll allow the character to join the Dreamspeakers, and players should discuss the way they’ll portray the mages first exposure to the Dream.</div><div>In game terms, a Dreamspeaker initiate always uses Arcane Experience to pay the first experience point stipend to his tutor. Here are some (but not all) of the ways in which he can acquire this Arcane Experience.</div><div><b>Astral Travel:</b>  An Astral journey that forces the mage to confront the deepest parts of his consciousness, or one that features the Dreamborn, can provide suitable Arcane Experience.</div><div><b>Derangements:</b>  Characters who explore the magical significance of a derangement gain Arcane Experience they can spend on becoming a Dreamspeaker, even if the derangement is cured (by raising Wisdom). Suggested methods include casting spells to satisfy the derangement’s urges, examining spirits drawn by the resonance of the mage’s psyche or even confronting spirits representing the derangement on the Astral Plane.</div><div><b>Paradoxes:</b>  Paradoxes that reflect the mage’s psyche can provide the insight needed to join the Legacy. Manifestations often take their shapes from a mage’s hopes and fears, while Branding can turn flaws in the mage’s soul into visible physical afflictions.</div><div><b>Tutors:</b> The process of finding and studying under a Legacy tutor is probably the easiest way to acquire the necessary Arcane Experience, but that doesn’t mean it’s too easy. Just meeting the tutor isn’t enough; he has to set the mage to arduous tasks that force her to question assumptions about herself and the universe. Tutors have set initiates on dangerous treks through the wilderness or city’s sewers. They’ve forced initiates to hunt powerful spirits and have demanded other intense, soul-testing activities.</div>",
        "magic": "<h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>New Merit: Dreamland (• to •••••)</h4><div><b>Prerequisite:</b> Awakened, Dreamspeaker Legacy </div><div>Effect: The mage may freely visit one or more locations in the Dreamtime. These Astral locations arise from the psychic resonance associated with a place.</div><div>Some Dreamspeakers say that the Dreamborn came to rest in such places, and that Dreamlands are the echoes of the Dreamborn’s own fitful dreams. Others say that ancestors won these places from the Dreamborn at the dawn of time, or that they merely arose after millennia of rites and initiations in the sacred place. Dreamspeakers can know multiple Dreamlands. Each one represents one Merit dot. A character does not require this Merit to reach a Dreamland, but he cannot access its wisdom without first purchasing this Merit.</div><div>Each Dreamland contains one dot of the Library background (see Mage: The Awakening, pp. 85–86). This usually doesn’t represent Astral books and scrolls, but visions of wise ancestors and Dreamborn who are willing to share their knowledge. This lore can often reveal histories — both mundane and supernatural — of the region that are otherwise unrecorded in any book or living memory.</div><div>Drawbacks: Dreamlands are at least 20 miles apart from one another. Each Dreamland’s physical location also has one essential feature that, if destroyed or changed (by construction or landscaping, for example), cuts off access to the Dreamland until the problem is repaired. </div>",
        "attainmentsDescrizione": "Dreamspeaker Attainments focus on understanding what most mages would call Astral Space. Dreamspeakers call it the Dream.

Accordingly, this Attainment enables Dreamspeakers to enter a waking trance that lets them sense the Dream and ordinary reality simultaneously.</div><div>Dreamspeakers with this Attainment can enter Astral regions without losing sight of the world. In effect, the Meditation roll to initiate Astral travel becomes an instant action that the character’s player may roll once per turn (rather than the usual 30 minutes per turn) until she reaches the desired Astral Plane. She does not need to be within a Demesne or Hallow to do this.</div><div>Once she reaches an Astral Plane, the Dreamspeaker can simultaneously perceive Astral and Material Realm phenomena; she can see and move through both regions at the same time. But aside from movement and perception, she must choose whether to act in one place or the other on any given turn. Phasing into one realm or the other (the Astral or the material) requires an instant action, after which she can act in that realm while continuing to perceive both realms. In all cases, however, her physical body remains in the Material Realm, and others in that realm can interact with her even if she is busy interacting with the Astral Plane. Witnesses who don’t know what she’s up to might believe her to be some sort of madwoman, pantomiming actions and speaking with non-existent beings. </div><div>If she is attacked by Astral beings while she is phased into that realm, she suffers Willpower damage per the normal rules for Astral combat. If she loses all her Willpower points, she instantly phases back into the material world and the Attainment’s effects end; it cannot be reused until she regains at least one Willpower point. </div><div>Furthermore, Dreamspeakers find it easier to rise through Astral Space than other mages; add a Dreamspeaker’s Mind dots to her extended action Meditation dice pool to attain Astral travel. This does not apply to instant action attempts at Astral travel involving this Attainment. </div><div>Dreamspeakers use Dreamwalking to travel to Astral regions that correspond with physical places. These realms have a sacred place in Dreamspeaker lore. Some have naturally evolved from the strong emotions surrounding a location. Others were constructed by Dreamspeakers or, in ancient days, by the Dreamborn themselves. These places serve as storehouses of secret knowledge that Dreamspeakers visit to help them solve particular problems.</div>",

Henceforth, she may activate this Attainment to add her Mind dots to a single Social or Mental Attribute, as if employing Augment the Mind (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 210) for a scene. Different Dreamborn augment different Attributes, so the Dreamspeaker must choose which Attribute (and which Dreamborn she contacts) to augment before she embarks on her Astral journey.<div>She can later choose to revisit the Dreamtime and negotiate wisdom from a different Dreamborn, allowing her to choose a different Mental or Social Attribute to augment with this Attainment.

The mage can also move his consciousness past Twilight and into Astral Space by using Dreamwalking’s instant action Astral travel while in Twilight.

He continues to lose an additional point of Willpower per hour per dot of Spirit  (i.e., a mage with Spirit 3 would lose an additional point every four hours), so long as he remains there, although he can reactivate this Attainment to allow him to try and traverse the Gauntlet again.

That may be the case for some, but if it affects the Tamers of the Cave that way, it’s hard to tell. Everything they do seems to be infused with a kind of infectious optimism. They bring hope and healing to the Sleepers around them.</div><div>It stands to reason. Unlike the other Elemental Masteries, whose chosen elemental forces are tangible and easily observable, the Tamers of the Cave master the void, the element of ether that scientists in previous centuries tried and failed to isolate.</div><div>If elemental ether was never found by Sleeper scientists, it’s precisely because ether doesn’t exist, by definition. Ether is the material of nothing, a non-substance that permeates and holds together the vast, empty void. Ether is the prime ingredient of ephemera, the not-living, nonexistent matter from which spirits and ghosts take their substance.</div><div>Similar to the other Elemental Masteries, the Tamers of the Cave become, in a way, their element. And they become a personification of the element’s manifestation. To harness ether, then, to “tame the Cave” is to make something out of nothing. Using the principle of like attracting like, the Tamer of the Cave draws void from void, creating a conduit between his body and the great nothingness outside space. He brings forth from his mouth an etheric mirror, a shining, starry, semi-liquid substance made of raw void. In his hands, it’s a malleable, versatile tool, and it forms the foundation of his magic, because, in effect he is the void. He is nothing and everything, all at once.</div><div>Manipulating — becoming — the material of spirits and ghosts gives the Tamers of the Cave a keen understanding of the life beyond. They might not necessarily know what’s to come just yet, but armed with their knowledge of the void, they have a confidence that whatever comes after life, they can make something of it. The Tamers of the Cave have seen how everything comes from nothing, how there is a material existence permeated and held together by the substance of nothingness. They are the void. What have they to fear?</div><div>The void is also, in the thinking of the Tamers, contradiction. The void is hope and despair, faith and disbelief, all at once. They become these things personified. They become contradiction. To “tame the Cave” is make contradiction their reason for being. They challenge the social order in which they live. “The Cave” can be seen as picture of the darkness in which so many people live, particularly the Sleepers. To tame that notional intellectual spiritual darkness is to challenge it, to show people to the exit of the cave. Some tamers do it quietly, encouraging people to question themselves and the social order in which they find themselves over long and eventful lives. Other Tamers stand tall and become activists, making themselves nuisances, burning bright and paying the ultimate price that prophets and visionaries have done for thousands of years. They’re not afraid of dying.</div><div>To the Tamers of the Cave, Death is not to be feared. It’s a doorway, they say, through which we must all pass. Perhaps it means a transmigration of the soul. Perhaps it’s just the simple continuation of matter and energy, dissipated into the rest of the universe. Perhaps Death really does means an afterlife in some kind of perfect Heaven.</div><div>Many believe in some sort of God, or at the very least in some kind of theory that life endures in some way beyond death. To many Tamers of the Cave, the lack of evidence for any kind of transcendent intelligence is all the more reason for faith. Faith for them thrives in the absence of evidence; their magic proves that nothingness produces and creates. Is it so implausible that a creator may be found in the emptiness?</div><div>They consider their lives cheap compared to the lives of others, even Sleepers. These Tamers share the Elemental Masteries’ philosophy — that their magic is there to benefit Sleeping humanity. As ones for whom death is not a thing to fear, the Tamers of the Cave are often not afraid to die for others, no matter how undeserving these others might be. There are stories of Tamers of the Cave whose sacrificial deaths were the magical tools to raise others from the dead, or even to bring about a single Awakening. There are stories of others who cheated death and rose again, before Ascending to higher states of being. They’re just stories, of course, but the stories persist. </div><div>They’re not all that helpful, these stories. These self-styled “Saints” have a reputation for throwing their lives away. It’s not undeserved. The problem with a Saint is that it takes a certain kind of person to fill that role, and 99 times out of 100, that person isn’t going to be the kind of person the average individual wants to sit down and have a drink with. As Tamers of the Cave grow in power and knowledge, they sometimes develop odd personality tics and messiah complexes. A Tamer of the Cave becomes intense and driven. Many begin to gain delusions about what they are and what they’re capable of. They become overconfident, unable to see that perhaps they are not quite the perfect Saints they should be. Possessed of a death wish, too many Tamers of the Cave sell their lives far too cheaply, achieving nothing, violating at the last the ethos of their Legacy. They die just for the sake of dying, fooling themselves that the miracles they seek to promote are going to happen anyway without any other action. </div><div>Tamers of the Cave are rare compared to the other Elemental Masteries, so rare that many mages outside of the Elemental Masteries don’t even believe these Tamers still exist. They have always been few in number, but during the last couple of hundred years, their numbers have fallen further and their few practitioners have become less and less like the men and women who won the Saints their sobriquet.</div><div>The Tamers of the Cave have traditionally recruited among people of faith. The twilight of traditional faith and the rise of fundamentalism, with its demands for simple, black-and-white truths and its inability to comprehend paradox, have a lot to do with this. People have always been willing to die for their faith, but the noble scapegoat of times past has given way to the suicide bomber and the creationist. Some people fear that a new dark age of ignorance, bigotry and violence coming upon us. Too many of the Tamers of the Cave who work their magic today seem to be the vanguard of the fundamentalists, rather than those who should, by rights, be holding it back. A large proportion of a small Legacy seem to be too keen to sacrifice themselves without purpose and without finding others to take their place. The Tamers of the Cave are dying out. Maybe it’s simply because their time has gone. Maybe the world has passed them by, and there is no real place for sacrifice in this world any more. Maybe there’s no place for hope.</div><div>The Tamers of the Cave who yet endure still cling to their ideals. They still have a place, they say. They still have work to do. This is their hope. For many, hope is all they have.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Saints. Sometimes Galileans or Socratics.",
        "orders": "The Tamers of the Cave have traditionally been exceptionally open to recruiting apostates. The kind of religious misfits whom the Legacy attracts are often the ones who could never have fully bought into the orders, with their secret formulae and tortuous conspiracies. Still, members of the orders do join the Legacy. Members of the Adamantine Arrow, while no strangers to death, have always found it hard to get their heads around suffering and dying for another rather than fighting. Still, there are Arrows who have joined the Tamers of the Cave, particularly during the 21st century. Many of these Arrows are those whose idea of sacrifice involves strapping explosives to themselves and slaughtering innocents.<div>Many mages who belong to the Mysterium find the idea of learning the secrets of the void immensely attractive. The Tamers of the Cave delve into the ultimate mystery, the fate of souls in the hereafter. It takes a selfish and reckless mage to want to find out the final secret to the extent that it doesn’t matter if he doesn’t come back to tell anyone else. There are many selfish and reckless mages.</div><div>The Guardians of the Veil have always held the Tamers of the Cave in suspicion. Guardians rarely become Saints, although, as is the case with the Arrows, a few have joined since the turn of the millennium. The Silver Ladder, on the other hand, has utopian ideals, even if the order doesn’t live up to them, and the Tamers of the Cave find that many of the best and brightest of their Legacy have come from the Ladder.</div><div>The arrival of the Free Council changed many things. Its permissive, open nature meant that here was an order in which the misfits who would join the Tamers of the Cave could feel comfortable. Most of the Saints who come from an order nowadays come from the Free Council.</div>",
        "appearance": "It’s impossible to categorize the Tamers of the Cave. They appear, for all the world, as if they’re ordinary. They look just like anyone else at first glance, with their ordinary street clothes, their ordinary haircuts and their ordinary shoes. It’s only when you speak to them that you see something of the Cave in them. There’s a certain eloquence all of them have, a certain disturbing quality in their eyes and voices. They are attractive and frightening, compelling and infuriating.<div>The Elemental Mark they bear on their nimbus is just as strange. It often carries completely contradictory characteristics, all at the same time. It can be bright and shadowy, silent and deafeningly loud, a stillness in the midst of a tempest.</div>",
        "background": "Unlike the other Tamers, the Saints take their pupils from any walk of life. They come from any gender, any ethnic group and any social class. They can join the Legacy at any age.<div>Philosophically, the Tamers of the Cave often have some kind of faith, although it’s rarely orthodox in form. A Christian Tamer of the Cave, for example, is much more likely to be a Gnostic than an orthodox Trinitarian. There are atheist Tamers of the Cave, although these too find it hard to be strictly materialist in the way they see the world.</div><div>Most Tamers of the Cave were altruistic in their attitude toward others, and optimistic in their outlook long before they joined the Legacy. Whatever they believe in, the Tamers of the Cave are, at least to begin with, psychologically robust individuals. They have to be the kind of people who can stare into the howling void and not just laugh, but to reach into it and to make something out of it. They have to be — or have to appear to be — the kind of people who can make something wonderful out of nothing at all. They’re the kind of people who become nothing and everything all at once, and laugh at the prospect. Or they should be. A very few let the nothingness take over, becoming unable to apprehend and work with the paradox of existence. These Saints develop a death wish that transcends ideology.</div><div>It doesn’t matter what they look like or where they come from; it doesn’t matter if they’re rich or poor, old or young. What matters is the soul within.</div>",
        "organizzation": "Similar to the other Elemental Masteries, the Tamers of the Cave work on the basis of a simple tutor-pupil relationship. Tutors usually don’t go out of their way to look for pupils. If a Tamer of the Cave sees a mage on the Path of Scourging whose disposition might make a worthwhile Saint, he approaches her, explains who he is and explains to her that he’d like to take her on as a pupil. He’s pretty open about it. He reasons that he has nothing to hide and if his potential pupil thinks that it’s the right thing to do, notwithstanding the suffering to follow, she’s probably going to work out.<div>It’s more rare for a student to go seeking out a Tamer of the Cave so that he can be taught the ways of the Legacy, but it still happens sometimes.</div><div>Technically, a Tamer of the Cave is supposed to offer succor to practitioners of the other Elemental Masteries, should one of them approach her for aid. In real terms, there’s no obligation on any Tamer of the Cave to fulfill this, although given their penchant for altruism, the Saints do, more often than not, give help when asked.</div><div>To the other Elemental Masteries, the Saints are an unknown quantity. They work well alongside all of the common Tamers in cabals, curbing the wild inspirational anger of the Tamers of Fire, tempering the cold judgment of the Tamers of Wind with compassion, showing the Tamers of Stone when their works are built on the sand and keeping the Tamers of Rivers grounded.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History and Culture</h2><div>The Tamers began as part of human culture, and in the beginning took on roles that were very much part of society. The Tamers of the Cave cultivated the role of the outsider, the prophet. Although unfashionable now, it’s a legitimate role. Plato’s tutor and friend Socrates saw himself as a gadfly, a constant source of irritation to a complacent, monolithic society. He showed a new way of constant inquiry, constant self-examination. He pointed others on the path to finding wisdom.</div><div>Jesus Christ spoke out against the religious and social establishment of his day, and gave many new hope and a new way of living. The role of the prophet is an ancient and honorable one. It doesn’t change the fact that society’s irritants, even though any healthy society should have them — needs to have them — suffer a terrible fate. Socrates and Jesus were killed by the establishments they challenged. That was their purpose and their destiny: to challenge and question, and to die. The Tamers of the Cave have fallen into that role for millennia, and for millennia, they’ve paid the price for it.</div><div>Thanks to the Quiescence, their role has shrunk. The Tamers of the Cave cannot be the open miracle-workers they once were, and they cannot take the role of leaders in mass movements. So, over the centuries, they’ve worked on a much smaller scale, either taking small parts in mass movements, or working to challenge individual lives, Sleeping and Awakened, one life at a time.</div><div>A Tamer of the Cave stood and died with the Diggers. The Radical Dissenters had a Tamer of the Cave among their number. There was a Tamer of the Cave in India following Gandhi, and a Tamer of the Cave in the civil rights struggle. Tamers of the Cave were there when the apartheid regime fell in South Africa. Tamers of the Cave were involved in the campaign for the abolition of slavery and the fight for women’s emancipation. There was a Tamer of the Cave at Wounded Knee.</div><div>Sleepers led these movements, and Sleepers changed things, but Tamers of the Cave stood alongside the Sleepers, and often died alongside them. And why not? Just as all the Tamers, the Saints see the Sleepers as important enough to live among and fight for.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Allegory of the Cave</h3><div>Imagine that everyone in the world has spent his entire life in a vast cave. There’s an exit, but no one can see it, because everyone is chained down in such a way that he can only see the back of the cave. Now shadows of various objects and ideas are projected against the back of the cave by unseen jailers. Because the people trapped in the cave don’t know any better, they think these shadows are in fact the real thing. Someone’s chains loosen. Maybe they break, maybe he figures out a way to escape. Blinking, he turns around and sees the sunlight. He covers his eyes and steps out of the cave into the outside world for the first time.</div><div>Gradually, he realizes that the cave wasn’t even a fraction of the world — his jailers tricked him. He returns to the cave, and tries to tell the people in there what he’s seen. He tries to get them out. Some of them don’t believe him. Some of them think he’s causing trouble. Maybe a few believe him and try to escape. Some even make it out and see the real world for themselves. But most stay in their chains, thinking that the cave is all there is.</div><div>Plato records Socrates as reckoning that this was what the world was like. The one who takes up philosophy and begins on the path of wisdom is like the one who gets out of the cave. The Tamers of the Cave teach the same allegory, but they interpret it in a different light. To them, the cave with all the people chained up in it and forced to take a limited, shadow reality, that’s still the world. But the unseen jailers are the Exarchs, whose will enforces the Quiescence, and the man who escapes his chains is one who Awakens to magic.</div><div>The reason the allegory us important to the Tamers of the Cave is because of the implications. They have to go back into the Cave, having seen the vastness of the Outside, because they need to try to free the Sleepers. Not all of them are going to listen, and of those who begin to question the world they live in, few will break their chains. But some, some are going to hear the word and break their chains. Some are going to Awaken. It’s the ultimate contradiction. It’s the ultimate expression of something inside every Sleeper that comes from nothing.</div><div>There’s a dream that one of the Tamers of the Cave had, more than 2,000 years ago, that perhaps they could do it, perhaps they could Awaken the entire human race. It’s failed. Never many, the Tamers of the Cave are dwindling away to nothing now, and their grand enterprise seems to have got them nowhere. Even so, that’s no reason to stop. Every human soul freed and Awakened is another spark of the Supernal, shining into the Fallen World. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Art of Dying</h3><div>Over the centuries, Tamers of the Cave have given their lives for the people they meet. Some of the Tamers of the Cave have made their entire lives into passion plays. They live in order to die. The Tamer of the Cave’s death can becomes a powerful sacrificial means of effecting change. Tamers of the Cave don’t set out to die, at least not to begin with. But it’s their role, their place as prophet and outsider, to suffer, and many do, just by taking on the role. However, a Tamer who embarks upon the Calvary road soon realizes that she is going to die.</div><div>She surrounds herself with friends, perhaps even taking on some pupils. And then she contrives to place herself in a narrative — a passion play — of her own death. Her friends might not realize that it’s happening, but she’ll contrive it so that they fall into roles, too — Beloved Disciple, Right Hand, Loyal Doubter, Loose Cannon and, of course, Traitor. Enemies are easier to find. Guardians of the Veil, who would kill for their tradition. Seers of the Throne, whose entire ethos depends upon enforcing the Quiescence. Vampires, who would kill without the interference of some crusading miracle-worker. Sleeper authorities, legitimate and criminal, who see a charismatic activist as a threat.</div><div>If the Tamer of the Cave does everything right, she’s going to suffer and die. In this world, there are plenty of opportunities to die. A real-life passion play is remarkably easy to set up, and the play can really be the thing, even to the extent that the setting up of the play can overtake the whole point of dying in the first place. It’s true that some mages join the Legacy because of a death wish. They might not even know they have it. A mage might fool herself that she’s got a cause to give herself to. In fact, she’s just caught up with the glamour of dying young, of being halfway between St. Sebastian and Kurt Cobain.</div><div>The Saints’ Attainments give them an intimate glimpse into the hazy state of existence called Twilight, where ghosts haunt the living and cling to anchors. Many mages, witnessing this place of lost shades, conclude that death is something to be avoided or controlled. Not so the Saints. They see past this image of trapped souls to something deeper. The ancient Tamers of the Cave did not believe, as the Atlanteans taught, that ghosts were empty shells of the living, capable of being manipulated like matter. The Tamers of the Cave taught that ghosts were shadows cast by departed souls — shadows that still had strong sympathetic ties to those souls. By freeing ghosts, the Saints freed souls.</div><div>This didn’t mean they went around dissolving anchors — some souls needed the confinement that their ghostly shadows’ suffered, so that the challenge of their continued existence could lead them to greater freedom once their ghosts resolved the issues that anchored them to the world. The Saints seek to challenge the dead as the Saint do the living, and free the dead only if they rise to the challenge. A few Tamers of the Cave have chosen to minister to the dead rather than the living, dying in sacrifice for those who have already passed that veil.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Atonement and Triumph</h3><div>The real question is, what’s the point? What does dying achieve that living and fighting can’t? Why should someone die? The answer is not a simple one, but it boils down to this: it’s magic. Magic doesn’t follow the rules of the Sleeping World. Magic doesn’t bow to any human logic. Sometimes the cause of magic needs a sacrifice.</div><div>In a chronicle of magic and enlightenment, a perverse act such as putting oneself in the path of death at the point of climax could change everything. A sacrifice like this can bring redemption. It can bring freedom. It can also be a crock, a pointless waste that achieves nothing except the consummation of a mage’s death-urge. The journey toward a sacrificial death, then, is not to be embarked upon lightly. It’s not a suicide, because the intention is to achieve something by it, and because there’s always the tiny hope, even if it’s unfounded, that death might not have to be the result of following this path.</div><div>And the achievement? The story goes that when a Tamer of the Cave dies, someone Awakens. Maybe the void, as an elemental force tied to the Fallen World, gives up the mage’s Awakened soul, bonding it with someone else. In the stories, that person is someone who knew the mage. It doesn’t have to be, of course. It could be a complete stranger, no more than someone who made eye contact moments before the mage died. Saints who study the ethos of sacrifice and redemption often find useful the different models of atonement that Christian theologians present.</div><div><b>Victory:</b> By choosing death, the Tamer of the Cave conquers it; it holds no fear for him, and no fear for any other. He suffers and dies to save lives, many lives. His death might result, but in dying, he gives his friends the time to escape, time to win through. In his final moments, his killers realize that they have not won, and that through killing him, they have defeated themselves, and that they have the consequences of his murder to deal with.</div><div><b>Penal Substitution:</b> The Tamer of the Cave contrives it so that he, innocent, dies in the place of someone who deserves to die. For example, the Saint switches places with an inmate on Death Row, moments before his execution. The sentence having been passed, the person whose life was saved owes it to the Saint to make something of his life. The formerly condemned man doesn’t have to acknowledge the debt. The choice is his. It’s up to him what he does with it.</div><div><b>The Ransom:</b> The Saint gives up her life so that others, who are imprisoned and innocent, can go free. Perhaps their imprisonment is literal — they might be in an internment camp, for example. Or maybe it’s figurative. Perhaps, when the Tamer dies on their behalf, enlightenment results. Their chains fall off, and they lift their heads and see the way of out of the cave for the first time. Perhaps it even means that they Awaken, en masse.</div><div><b>Solidarity:</b> The Tamer of the Cave pours out her life for the downtrodden, the poor, the diseased, the suffering. Perhaps AIDS victims. Perhaps the homeless and disenfranchised. Perhaps 100 slave-labor sweatshop workers in the Philippines. By dying for them, she shows that she is prepared to share in their suffering, even their deaths, in order to support and protect them. She provides an example, and through her death enfranchises and inspires many of those whom the rest of society has discounted. The rest is up to them.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Death Is Not the End</h3><div>Is that the end? Perhaps not. Rumors persist of Tamers of the Cave who return, briefly, to life after having died, to teach their friends and work more miracles, before finally vanishing forever.</div><div>There are a few who swear blindly, even today, that their tutor, who died, rose again — literally, bodily rose again. He gave words of encouragement, words of warning, and then vanished from their sight. Could it be that a Tamer of the Cave can transcend death? And if so, what could one who has died and rose again achieve? And where would he go when his work was done? Some say that Tamers of the Cave often become ghost mages (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 327), although others claim that Saints never do. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>False Prophets</h3><div>Prophets aren’t always right, and they’re not always spotless. Christ wasn’t the only prophet of change of his day, and he wasn’t the only miracle-worker. There were others, some who led their followers to their deaths, or who abandoned the faithful when they most needed their prophets.</div><div>A prophet often finds followers and the affirmation of those followers can make a person with mystical powers, especially one so prone to Hubris, arrogant. The people who hang on a prophet’s words place him on a pedestal, and that pedestal can be narrow, tall and unstable. The followers of a false prophet (or even a true prophet) can turn on their former master and end him. There’s that old, bleak joke about the church congregation who stoned their preacher to death, arguing that the Bible said that you should stone a false prophet, and that since it said nothing about not stoning a real prophet, it was better to be on the safe side.</div><div>Even if they don’t turn on him, the prophet can find himself using the faithful. There are news stories every year about leaders of religious groups who take the faithful for every penny they have, use members of their congregation as sex objects or who inspire them to do darker, more violent things.</div><div>And then there’s dying. A prophet doesn’t have to die, but many do. Not all of them die for any reason more than they’ve got a death wish. A prophet with a powerful personality can easily bring his followers to die with him, possibly through mass suicide (for example, the Heaven’s Gate cult or the inhabitants of Jonestown) or acts of suicidal violence in aid of the “cause.” The number of Tamers of the Cave is small. Fewer still act this way. Few fall. But as time goes on, the number of those who abuse their flocks, who fall prey to nihilism, who die for no reason, is growing steadily. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction </h2><div>The Tamers of the Cave have never been the most attractive of Legacies. Prophets, especially potential martyrs, don’t appear spontaneously. Experienced Tamers are always looking for pupils. Those who approach a Tamer of the Cave and ask to join the Legacy are often given a fair chance, although the tutor should try to ascertain whether the potential pupil is cut out for the role or not.</div><div>The problem often lies in the simple fact that it’s difficult to tell a real passionate outsider from someone who simply has a death wish, either consciously or unconsciously. Some Tamers of the Cave accept as pupils people who need therapy, not teaching.</div><div>Assuming, after a pupil has been told what initiation entails, that the pupil still wants to go through with it, the prospective Tamer of the Cave retreats to a lonely place and fasts and, under the guidance and supervision of the tutor, meditates on 99 traditional paradoxical phrases, learning them by heart with the tutor’s help and repeating them over and over. This could take a few days. It could take weeks. It goes on until the pupil dies.</div><div>He doesn’t really die. The hunger, thirst and constant meditation send the pupil into an altered state of consciousness, where he experiences death. For three days, he knows exactly what it means to be dead, and in those three days, when he experiences the joy of resurrection, he is transformed. He understands that he has become hope and despair, everything and nothing, creation and void.</div><div>The tutor is there all the time and — perhaps because of the connection brought about by the exertion of his will — knows when her pupil is likely to come back to life. When the pupil returns, crying, taking in great gulps of air as if he never figured out to breathe before, the tutor is there, with a simple meal and some water. The vegetables, bread and water taste better than anything the pupil has ever eaten.</div><div>Tutor and pupil work closely together, over the next few weeks. The tutor helps the pupil create the etheric mirror for the first time, and trains him in sculpting it and using it. Each further Attainment involves a long period of fasting and meditation, although not to the point of death, apparent or otherwise. Each time, the tutor is there to help the pupil work with his new ability.</div>",
        "magic": "",
        "attainmentsDescrizione": "<div>The central principle behind the magic of the Saints is the “etheric mirror,” a malleable substance created from the void itself. It’s similar but not identical to ephemera, the stuff of spirits and ghosts.The Tamer of the Cave has become the void, and thus, he can draw more of the void through himself. He spits it out and works it with his hands into a form that he can use to create his magic, in much the same way as a mage using the Death Arcanum might work with ectoplasm. The etheric mirror isn’t so much black as it is the color of the void. It appears to be a window, through which one can see infinite space, stars and all. Sometimes it takes on a reflective mirror-sheen (the legendary “magic mirror” of shamans). Sometimes it becomes white and opaque. Whatever it’s used for, when the Tamer of the Cave has finished using it, it vanishes in about a minute.</div><div>Practically every spell cast by a Tamer of the Cave could be cast using this substance in some way, and he can use it as a dedicated casting tool. He doesn’t have to, but many Saints do. A Saint casting a healing spell, for example, spits out a handful of the etheric mirror, which he spreads over the injury he wants to heal. As the spell does its work, the void stuff fades away. If he wants to create a scrying window, he does much the same thing, spitting the etheric mirror onto a wall or table, and using his hands to spread it out into a real mirror, which clears and becomes the window through which he can see through to other places and dissolves into the air when the spell is done.</div><div>All of the Saints’ Attainments depend upon the Etheric Communion — a Tamer of the Cave has to produce the etheric mirror (using the first Attainment) before he can then use it to create the effects of the second and third Attainments. </div>",

A hard-bitten killer might see his long-dead mother expressing shame at what he’s become (the object is that he repents). A bigoted preacher could imagine himself caught in the flames of Hell.

Ever since the very beginnings of civilization, there have been the warriors and the statesmen, the men and women of honor and bright inspiration. The Taming of wild, dangerous Fire is one of the very first things that humans did, arguably the point at which they became fully human, as they took on the power and responsibility of the flame.</div><div>The Tamers of Fire harness that primal energy. In their hearts, the Fire has the same power, the same wild abandon, the same need for responsibility and restraint. Fire, for these Champions, is the element of will, unstoppable and implacable, against which the only sane response is to stand down. Fire is the element of intuition, of innovation, the fire that triggered the beginnings of human civilization. Fire is the element of leadership, the pillar of fire in the wilderness that leads the invading hordes into the Promised Land, to buy it with blood and steel. Fire is the element of trial, the burning, cleansing flame that refines and purifies in pain and heat, incinerating the dross and leaving the gold. </div><div>Fire is also the element of anger, of rage uncontrolled, that burns and destroys. Fire is the element of madness. Fire is the element of destruction. Fire is transient and temporary. One day, it is impossible to fight against; the next, it has burnt itself out. In Taming the Fire, the Champions embody all of these aspects. In the process of soulcrafting, they grow to understand their element, to mold it and make it their tool. They become the fire, and through becoming the fire, take on the role of the hero. Their magic concentrates on the fire in every respect: on the uncanny manipulation of the physical flame, and in the inner fire of inspiration and courage. </div><div>The hero was a superhuman figure. He stood in the space between humans and god. The Tamers of Fire stand in that place. Through the act of soulcrafting, they become the fire. The Tamers believed that Fire was inspiration and rage and destruction and courage, that the abstract concept and the elemental force were the same thing. The mage is also these things — he just doesn’t know it yet. By taking the fire within himself, he becomes the fire. He becomes inspiration. His is the “hand that dare seize the fire,” because he is the fire.</div><div>In this age of Quiescence, others might think that the Tamers of Fire need to limit their exploits. They’re still heroes, but their magic needs to be smaller, the scope of their heroism smaller. But the fire that they have become won’t allow itself to be quenched. They defy the Quiescence. The fire rages against all limits. The fire will not be stopped until it is doused altogether. The Quiescence has the power to do that to the Champions’ magic, certainly, but fire will not back down. It can’t be reasoned with. It can’t be made to change its mind.</div><div>Except that the Tamers know that it can. The fire is in everyone. They just don’t know it. A passionate speaker can sway the fire within a man’s heart. The same rhetorical techniques can, in the employ of a Tamer of Fire, sway the very fires themselves. Some of these Champions aim for inspiration through excellence. Some excel in the field of sports. Others inspire through words, becoming crusading activists, defenders of rights, leaders in their field. Others still become heroes in their work: there are firefighters, police officers, paramedics and soldiers among the Tamers. The days when a man or woman could transform the entire world and be remembered for millennia are long gone. But sometimes small triumphs are enough. It’s the way of the hero to blaze brightly and burn out. If the hero burns more dimly and flickers to nothing that much faster, what of it? In this world, any fire at all is enough.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Champions",
        "orders": " Given the martial nature of so many of the Tamers of Fire, it’s no surprise that so many of them come from the Adamantine Arrow. Although the Silver Ladder’s more hardline members are wary of the way the Champions value ties with the Sleepers, the Ladder has a need for heroes in these dark days, and many Ladders see the superhuman potential of the Champions as a means to find a new kind of future. The Mysterium has its scholars, but there are always those who would raid ancient ruins and interpret ancient lore in new, brightly intuitive ways. They, too, look to join the Tamers of Fire. Although the Free Council has, perhaps, less time for heroes stepping out of myth, this order has its own great men, and the Libertines find Champions whose fire is directed toward reform and the advancement of human rights attractive.<div>The Tamers of Fire draw very few of their recruits from the Guardians of the Veil. The Guardians have long thought the Tamers of Fire to be careless braggarts, who waste their magic  on the Sleepers and court Paradoxes. Most of the Tamers of Fire, meanwhile, have little time for the paranoia and strict control that the Guardians seem to hold so dear.</div>",
        "appearance": " The Tamers of Fire can come from any walk of life. Many are good-looking and in fine physical shape. Although the skin on their arms and chests is sometimes marred after a while with small burns, most of the Tamers of Fire know how to avoid harm from flames, and a Champion with serious burn scars is rate. Eloquence is a must. Tamers of Fire often work their magic by convincing the flames to obey them. A person needs to be pretty convincing to do that.<div>A Champion’s nimbus alters as he takes on the first Attainment of the Legacy, and develops a fiery, powerful quality. Blazing angels sing. Flames appear to burst from the mage’s skin. Lightning flashes around the mage. Even when not visible, the Elemental Mark has its effect. The Tamers of Fire could be the epitome of the figure with burning eyes, the bright, bold, charismatic hero.</div>",
        "background": "Anyone can be a hero. In myth, the hero is just as often a lowly shepherd as he is the son of a king, a Maid of Orleans as often as the daughter of the King of France. The hero, and hence the Champion, is defined in spite of his or her origin, not because of it. The Tamers of Fire don’t go looking for their pupils. Their pupils make themselves known to the Tamers. They look for Theurgists who distinguish themselves as leaders, as people of courage, and not just physical courage.  They value intellectual courage and spiritual courage just as much, and value most of all an individual with the courage of his or her convictions.<div>More Tamers of Fire are male than female. There is an unfortunate vein of sexism running through the Legacy’s history, and women who join the Champions often have to prove themselves to be better than the men in order to be accepted as equals. Even the most radical Tamers of Fire are somewhat patriarchal in their radicalism.</div><div>Governments come and governments fall, but in the eyes of the Tamers of Fire, there will always be governments of some kind. The Tamers of Fire might sometimes be revolutionaries, but they are rarely anarchists. The hero is a part of the social order, and needs a social order to be part of. His relationship with his order works on the same lines. A Tamer of Fire tends not to challenge the status quo of his order. He finds other battles to fight.</div>",
        "organizzation": " A Tamer of Fire who sees a likely pupil tests him. The test, traditionally, is part of the initiation. A tutor takes on only those pupils whom he considers to be worthy of the Legacy. A potential Tamer of Fire who approaches another to be taught has to prove himself worthy. Similar to David, who had to prove himself by slaying the Philistine giant, a possible student might have to undergo a quest or achieve some seemingly impossible feat.<div>As with the other Elemental Masteries, there’s an expectation for Tamers of Fire to respect and aid other bearers of the Elemental Mark, but it’s not an obligation. The only real bond among the Tamers of Fire is the bond that links tutor and pupil, and even that can be shaky. When individuals driven by such wild passions come together, fireworks all too often result.</div><div>The other Elemental Masteries respect and fear the Tamers of Fire in equal measure. The Tamers of Winds give the Tamers of Fire direction, and in return they supply passion. The Tamers of Stone, who are more grounded by definition, supply the foundation from which the Champions can base their work. Awkwardness characterizes their relationships with the Tamers of Rivers. Fire and water rarely mix, and when they do, tempers often rise to boiling point as the direct Tamers of Fire and the subtle Tamers of Rivers clash over methods. Still, both the Champions and the Travelers recognize that they need each other, even if, in practice, they differ on how best to serve their society.</div>",
        "suggestedOblations": " Starting a campfire in the middle of nowhere by the “two sticks” method. Firewalking. Spending an entire night in physical training. Organizing a match of a team sport. Running a marathon. Burning your skin repeatedly with small flames from a lighter or a candle.",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Culture</h2> <div>In ancient times, heroes fought their way across the landscape of primal myth. From the Irish Cú Chulaind to the Sumerian Gilgamesh to the Greek Herakles, from Romulus to Siegfried to Beowulf to Samson, the heroes faced monsters, fought, killed and died. </div><div>Chances are that none of these men strictly existed beyond vague memories, written down after centuries of oral tradition. But then, that’s part of the point. It’s the idea of the hero that’s important, not whether what he did is historically accurate. Over the centuries, the Tamers of Fire have tried to be the Champions they claim to be. It’s been theirs to protect, lead and inspire others in a thousand different ways. </div><div>They protect the weak and rescue the endangered. They take the roles of rescue and medical workers in dozens of countries. They inspire by example. They perform acts of foolhardy bravery and athletic skill. They run marathons, become professional sportsmen. They go to war and win medals, inspiring others to lay their lives on the line for their ideals. </div><div>The Fire is a two-edged sword. The Fire brings liberty, but the Fire also brings extremism. It sweeps across the field, bringing change, but rages out of control. The Revolutions in Russia and France were both borne on a fire of inspiration that rapidly got out of control. The torch of liberty became its funeral pyre, as reigns of terror in both nations burnt away the good as well as the bad. The First World War began as a great patriotic venture in dozens of countries, and wiped out a whole generation of young men. What good were the ideals of the hero when 100,000 men could die in an afternoon, lost forever in an agony of gas, blood and sucking mire? </div><div>Even now, the Champion can go too far. Perhaps a Tamer of Fire blindly follows a flawed leader or a discredited philosophy. Perhaps the Champion falls prey to the easy certainties of violent fundamentalism. Perhaps in his desire to champion one cause, he performs terrible acts against the followers of another. Or maybe he simply no longer sees those who disagree with him as fully human. </div><div>The Fire brings inspiration, but it brings madness. Herakles’ strength gave gods and monsters cause to quake, but his rage gripped him to the extent that he slew his own children without knowing what he was doing. </div><div>The Tamers of Fire can also fall prey to madness. Like the Fire that is bonded with them in essence, they have the potential to cause vast destruction. </div><div>The Tamers of Fire are the best known of the Elemental Masteries among the Awakened. Their fellow mages sometimes see them as heroes. Just as often they consider the Champions to be braggarts and loose cannons, dangerously flawed nearlunatics: point them at the enemy and stand well back, but don’t trust them for anything more.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Temporary As Achilles</h3> <div>True heroes are flawed. The superhuman paragon beloved of the Hollywood action movie is no hero. The true hero is human, and just as any other human being, he has limitations. A hero becomes a hero by transcending these limitations. A true superhuman can only become so by recognizing his flawed humanity and refining it in the furnace. </div><div>There are several ways a hero can be flawed. Tamers of Fire don’t go out of their way to pick flawed pupils, but the kind of people who bear the mark of heroism are often the kind of people who have needed to defeat their limitations. </div><div><b>Physical Flaws:</b> Some of the great heroic figures of history and myth had physical drawbacks that they overcame or addictions they fought their entire lives. Horatio Nelson and Quintus Sertorius were one-eyed. Nelson had only one arm. Julius Caesar was epileptic. Oedipus was abandoned as a child with a metal spike through his foot, and walked for the rest of his life with a limp. </div><div><b>Mental Flaws:</b> Psychological weaknesses can also prove disastrous for the hero. Herakles went mad; Achilles was prone to irrational rages. Alexander was an alcoholic and a megalomaniac. Oedipus’ inability to know when to stop asking questions proved his downfall. Samson’s weakness for a pretty face cost him dearly. </div><div><b>Social Flaws:</b> Some heroes have terrible secrets, or have made enemies from terrible mistakes they made in their pasts. Oedipus was destroyed by a terrible secret that even he didn’t know. Arthur’s plot to destroy the incest-born son who was prophesied to kill him not only failed, but turned the boy against him and sealed his fate. </div><div><b>Mystical Flaws:</b> A very few heroes suffer from flaws with a magical or divine origin. Cú Chulaind was doomed to die if he ate a dog, but was under an injunction never to refuse hospitality if offered — when a woman invited him into her home and gave him a stew made from dogmeat, he had no choice but to accept it and die. Samson’s supernatural strength depended on the length of his hair.</div><div> <h4 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Flaws and Characters</h3> <div>Many of the imperfect heroes of myth had several imperfections. A Tamer of Fire character probably has at least one Flaw (see the World of Darkness Rulebook, p. 217) — if she doesn’t, there’s always the chance she’ll develop one or more as she develops the Attainments of the Flame. The heroes of legend didn’t always begin their lives with their Flaws, and there’s no reason a Tamer of Fire character shouldn’t gain a Flaw as time goes on. </div><div>Notionally, the more Flaws a Champion has, the more “mythic” in stature she can be. Powerful Tamers of Fire could have many Flaws. Players’ characters, on the other hand, aren’t usually powerful to begin with, let alone mythic. Not yet, anyway. With a more average starting character, one Flaw can provide plenty of interesting plot complications. The point of Flaws, particularly with the Tamers of Fire, is to provide a limitation that a character has to conquer. Too many could make a character unplayable.</div> <h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Once a Tamer of the Fire has chosen the one he wants to teach, the Champion puts his prospective pupil through a hero’s ordeal. The pupil might not even realize it — the initiation takes the form of a journey in the real world, with real dangers, a quest partly contrived by the tutor. </div><div>First comes the Call. The tutor asks the mage to go on the quest, without telling her why. Here, the prospective pupil may not wish to begin the quest. This Refusal is usual — in fact, it’s to be expected; some tutors treat as failures those who go on the quest without some initial hesitation, reasoning that a hero may be brave, but should not, ideally, be foolhardy. </div><div>If the pupil has refused to answer the call once, the tutor appears and explains something more of the quest, and why it is important. Perhaps he appeals to the pupil on moral grounds. Perhaps he appeals on the grounds of self-knowledge. Either way, he produces a spiritual carrot on a stick, leading the pupil to the next stage, a First Trial. The enemy may be real. The quest may be truly dangerous. It may involve the pupil’s friends, and there is no shame in that. A series of tests follow: a test of skill, a test of knowledge, a test of integrity, a physical test, leading to a place of darkness, a Cave , where the pupil faces a life-threatening ordeal. If the hero-in-training gets out alive, she needs to escape. It’s here that the tutor reveals all. If the pupil is willing to continue, she is granted a vision of the Flame, burning away the imperfections in her soul. It’s now she is a full member of the Legacy. </div><div>Each subsequent Attainment works in the same way — a real quest, a real journey, which ends with a vision of the Flame. Each time the tutor is there at beginning and end to send the pupil on her way and to show her the refining Fire and guide her to the next Attainment.</div>",
        "magic": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2> The Tamers of Fire master fire in all of its forms. Their magic controls the flame in its physical and symbolic manifestations. It can be a terrible, glorious thing to see a Champion, blazing brightly, with a band of friends who’d die for each other at his side and an army of living flames springing from his hand. They’re also adept in the magic of the mind. To the Tamers of Fire, it’s the same thing. When they work with fire, they talk to it, convince it to do their bidding. The mind and the fire are one and the same, and if the heart of a man can be swayed by impassioned talk, so can the fire itself.",
        "attainmentsDescrizione": "Each of the Champions’ Attainments depends upon fire. However, since the Tamers of Fire consider heroic abstracts such as inspiration, courage and rage to be the same thing, the fire can be symbolic as well as literal. Attainment effects that alter physical flames (using Forces synergy) require the Tamer  of Flame to have a small flame of his own that he can use as a focus to affect the flames. Many Tamers of Fire smoke. Most keep a box of matches or a lighter on their persons.<div>Attainments that use the symbolic flame need a different kind of fire, the fire of flashing eyes and passionate talk. Tamers of Flame at work are quite marvelous to behold. Their oratory can transform lives, bring down governments and move people to stunning feats of bravery.</div>",

        "thirdAttainmentDescription": "With Forces 4, the Tamer of Fire finds that his own body can become a furnace for the Flame. As an instant action, he can cause his body to give off intense amounts of heat, enough to ignite nearby flammable objects. The Champion’s player rolls Presence + Intimidation; the successes determine the intensity of the flame and the damage it inflicts (one lethal point per success), similar to Potency points in the “Firestarter” spell (see above). Unlike that spell, the effects of Become the  Fire are confined to a one-yard radius around the mage. The mage is immune to this heat, and anything he wears or carries will not ignite. Anyone trying to attack the Tamer with melee combat suffers from the incredible heat, suffering its damage per turn of contact. In addition, anything flammable that the person is wearing or holding might catch fire. The Storyteller should keep track of the amount of heat damage inflicted per turn; if the cumulative amount exceeds a flammable object’s Durability, the object ignites. The Tamer of Fire has enough control over the effect that he can exempt certain people or objects from the worst of his heat, so that they do not suffer damage or ignite. He can exempt one object in his radius (in addition to those he carries) per Gnosis dot per turn. The Tamer of Fire can cancel this Attainment with an instant action.",

A word of criticism here, an encouragement there, a revelatory phrase, and the hearts of the mage’s friend burn within them. Their eyes see more clearly, their minds think faster, their own tongues speak more powerfully. This Attainment is similar to the effect of the Mind 4 spell “Augment Other Minds” (see  Mage: The Awakening, p. 213), except that the mage rolls Presence + Expression + Mind. The mage can augment one of the subject’s Mental or Social Attributes by one dot for each success he gains."

Has it not the voice of a king, of a warrior, of a bull, of a nightbird, of a pregnant woman and a sighing man, and a thousand other voices?”</i> </div><div><i>“It is so,” nodded Vasudeva, “the voices of all living creatures are in its voice.”</i> </div><div>— Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha </div><div>You can’t swim in the same river twice. The water flows, constantly, in constant flux, constant change. The waters renew themselves constantly, and gradually change the nature of their landscape. The waters have many voices for change. </div><div>The waters are the very origin of creation. They’re the living fount from which all other things take their being. The symbolic river runs to the primordial ocean, which contains all life forces. The waters bring fertility. The rain that waters the parched land brings life from what once was barren and dead. </div><div>The waters excite sensation. The gentle flow of water across human skin. The rise and fall of the fluids in the body dictates the physical response to desire, the transfer of life borne in water its culmination, its purpose. </div><div>The waters purify. Catholics flock in their thousands to the holy shrine of Lourdes to experience the healing powers of its waters. Hindus visit the sacred city of Varanasi, to cleanse themselves in the restorative waters of the Ganges. </div><div>The waters erode. The waters constantly alter their surroundings. The gradual erosion of the rocks happens over millennia. And yet, the gentle, persistent movement of the waters hides frightening powers. Water can just as easily bring destruction and death, in the devastating power of a tsunami, the wild, unpredictable anger of a flash flood. The river, without warning, becomes the mysterious depths that kill and annihilate. Water is healing and fertility, but water is also the dark habitation of demonic powers, the element of “tehom” or Tiamat — the dragon of watery chaos. The principle of life becomes a principle of death all too easily. </div><div>To Tame the River is to become water, and to become all of these principles. The Tamers of Rivers, for as long as they have practiced their magical arts, have claimed to have held the keys to life and death and everything that lies beyond. They’re all change, all transformation, and, like the path of the conceptual River that represents all rivers, it’s a constant journey, from spring to river to sea to sky to ground to spring . . . and back again. </div><div>Their role in society has always to be agents of change in all things. Sometimes they join with artists and radicals. Sometimes they’re activists. Sometimes they’re healers and teachers. Rarely do they stick with one job or one identity. The Tamers of Rivers make the constant flow their tool. The unpredictability of this River, the symbolic representation of what they have become, makes soulcrafting fraught with pain and personal insecurities. </div><div>Every artist knows that, just as the ability to create beauty comes from somewhere outside of herself, so the source of her inspiration could just as suddenly dry up. Every inspired healer knows that, someday, his ability to heal could simply disappear, irretrievably and forever. </div><div>The River can run dry. This fear, that one day their power could be made drought, inspires many to continue creating. Many do so at a prodigious rate, feeling compelled to do as much as possible before the power to do so deserts them. Many Tamers of Rivers experience periods, which can be anything from a few days to months or years at a time, when they feel devoid of creative energy. They ebb and flow, going through phases of low and high water. When the rain of inspiration has not fallen for some time, the Tamers of Rivers can embark on periods of the blackest depression. Most come out of the other side of times like this, springing from the dry ground with renewed vigor and freshness. Some may fall into cynicism and stagnate, no longer having the will to continue developing the Attainments of the River. </div><div>Tamers of Rivers, like the River itself, don’t settle in one place for very long. Historically, they were always travelers. Part of a tradition that began among some of the earliest matrilineal societies, they moved from tribe to tribe, city to city, promoting the arts of healing and childcare and teaching the benefits of culture, literacy and the arts. </div><div>These days, many of the “Travelers” have permanent homes, but the need to keep on the move still lingers. Many move their home at least once a year, and avoid putting down firm roots for fear of getting stuck in one place. The principle of their soulcrafting depends on them becoming water, becoming constant change, becoming embodiments of frequent movement. The idea of spending a lifetime living and working in a single city or town is all but anathema: still waters soon become stagnant waters. If they take jobs at all, they usually avoid office jobs, preferring the freedom of jobs that let them move around. Their relationships are frequently fraught with difficulties. Lovers of Tamers of Rivers often accuse them, not always unfairly, of a fear of commitment. </div><div>Similar to the other Elemental Masteries, the Tamers of Rivers value the Sleepers and choose to live among them. Having been, in a real sense, reborn, the Travelers feel compelled to share some of their newfound energies with those around them, to put things right, to restore wholeness and completeness and bring beauty into a world that is often ugly and fragmented. </div><div>Not everyone welcomes their interventions. Not everyone considers a perfect society to be an itinerant one. Many other mages dismiss the Tamers of Rivers as oddballs. This doesn’t stop them from trying to help and sharing their vision with the world. Mages who have given their all to the River are not doing it for respect and praise.</div>They’re doing it because they can’t help it.",

        "orders": " Few Tamers of Rivers come from the Adamantine Arrow. The Tamers of Rivers are quite simply not martial, and while they’re not necessarily hostile to the Arrows, the Arrows usually see the Travelers as something of an irrelevance. Likewise, members of the Guardians of the Veil have little time for the principles of constant change the Tamers of Rivers espouse, and very few consider the Travelers a fit course to take.<div>The Tamers of Rivers are, however, very at home in the Free Council. Libertines have joined the Tamers of Rivers for as long as they have existed. The Mysterium, too, has time for the Travelers’ magic. The Mysterium’s members often value travel — it’s a great way to gather information, and a reason to join, although not the only reason. Mages in the Silver Ladder, too, has few issues with the Travelers. Although their hierarchical structure and views toward the Sleepers can be a real sticking point, the utopian (and yet often traditionalist) ideals of many of the Tamers of Rivers are attractive to the more idealistic members of the Ladder.</div>",
        "appearance": "Tamers of Rivers often have an intuitive sense of style and harmony about them. They are good at choosing clothes that co-ordinate. They often have a natural eye for color and design. Although, superficially, they dress pretty much like everyone else, they usually add their own flourishes to their outfits. Even in a formal setting, they wear something that gives away a hint of their creative, dynamic nature, whether it be red stripes in an otherwise immaculate hairstyle or a hand-painted pendant beneath a classically cut suit.<div>They often dress provocatively, and they can be very tactile in the way they relate to others. They talk openly about things that many people find embarrassing — relationships, illnesses, personal histories.</div><div>The Elemental Mark transforms their nimbus, giving it some of the conceptual nature of water. Perhaps it makes the Traveler seem as though she’s visible through deep water. Perhaps the viewer develops the uncomfortable sensation of being immersed in deep water.</div>",
        "background": " Many Tamers of Rivers come from medical or creative backgrounds. Some may also be engaged in areas that bring people together, such as trade or diplomacy. <div>When the Tamers of Rivers first appeared, the Travelers were entirely female. In the modern, Fallen World, they’re still mostly women. A few men have joined the Legacy over the last few decades, challenging the perception of many Awakened within the Elemental Masteries of the nature of their “women’s magic.” Many modern Tamers of Rivers express their magic through various neo-pagan expressions of religion. For many of the Tamers of Rivers, the nature of the revitalizing power of the River lies in healing and the bringing of wholeness. That which is ugly must be transformed into something beautiful, either metaphorically or physically. Beautiful things still have room for improvement and room for change, and should become something more beautiful. A Tamer of Rivers might work to mend a broken relationship. That same Traveler might spend just as much time adding an element of conflict to a perfectly healthy relationship, keeping it (in the mage’s eyes) from stagnating. </div><div>Childbirth and fertility were ancient concerns of the Tamers of Rivers. Although the business of bearing children is, in the developed West, nowhere near as difficult as it was in times past, there are many Travelers who have a particular affinity with children. The lore of the Tamers of Rivers idealized children. The Travelers speak, not always entirely accurately, of the value of children’s innocence, their ability to see things through “untainted” eyes.</div>",
        "organizzation": " The Tamers of Rivers are among the most scattered and most disparate of the Elemental Masteries. Few live near to their tutors. In the old days, tutors and pupils would only interact when their respective journeys’ paths crossed. In this era of email and cell phones, arranging to meet up in advance is easy. <div>Tamers of Rivers often go out of their way to find pupils. New blood is development, and development is evolution. Because of the peripatetic lifestyles so many of them lead, Tamers of Rivers often have several pupils at any one time, although they might not know that they are not their tutors’ only pupils. Tutors, on the other hand, can be difficult for aspiring Travelers to find. In fact, some gain the right to initial instruction simply through succeeding in finding a tutor. </div><div>Similar to the other Elemental Masteries, tutors explain to their pupils about the theoretical sense of kinship and obligation the Tamers of Rivers have with others who bear the Elemental Mark (including other Tamers of Rivers). In practice, it means that they’re likely to be well-disposed towards most others of the Elemental Masteries, but go no further than that, only really giving as much aid as they want. </div><div>The Tamers of Rivers work well alongside the Tamers of Stone and Tamers of Winds. The Tamers of Winds under stand the Travelers the best out of the Masteries, and while the Tamers of Winds have a very different approach to their watery brethren, the Tamers of Winds have a good grasp of the way that the Tamers of Rivers see truth and change. The Tamers of Rivers and the Tamers of Winds complement each other. The rather cold but measured approach of the Tamers of Winds tempers the emotionalism of the Travelers, whose primal, sensual nature takes the hard edges from the others’ cerebral approach to their magic. </div><div>Tamers of Rivers clash with Tamers of Fire, feeling uneasy with the Champions’ martial attitude, who, in turn, have difficulty with the way that the Tamers of Rivers put themselves at risk. But both Legacies recognize the need for each other among the Elemental Masteries.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History and Culture</h2> <div>Human history has always depended upon change. Progress, however one conceives it, depends upon constant movement. Change is natural. Change is evolution. Change is the nature of water. Water is the most primal, basic element of human physiology. </div><div>Like attracts like. As embodied change, the Tamers of Rivers need to create change. They need to create wholeness, but it’s a certain kind of wholeness they want. Progress for progress’s sake is not, for the Tamers of Rivers, an adequate end in and of itself. Their attitude to progress is something of a paradox. They don’t really want the world to change. In fact, many of them see “progress” in the classic Victorian sense as a bad thing. The change they seek to create is the amount of change necessary to avoid stagnation. It’s the old saw: you have to change to stay the same; by staying the same, you become better. </div><div>The way the Travelers see it, they’ve always been what human society needed. Tutors in the Tamers of Rivers describe the ancient Legacy as a group dedicated to creating wholeness and beauty through change and growth, through the fertility of water, through encouraging the acceptance of sexuality and through the healing power of water. </div><div>In ancient Greece, the Tamers of Rivers identified the central, symbolic River from which they drew their powers with Oceanus, the personification of the enormous river that they believed circled the world-disc. Oceanus’ consort was his sister Tethys, and from their union came the three thousand Oceanids, the ocean nymphs from whom flowed all the rivers of the world. </div><div>As a mystical sign, some Tamers of Rivers did at one point follow the example of the Ur-River-God and married their siblings. The practice died out long ago, but even so, there are quite persistent and pernicious rumors among the Awakened about the Travelers’ sexual proclivities, even now, hundreds of years after the practice has been abandoned. </div><div>Having once entered the River of Oceanus, the Travelers cannot help but find themselves encircled by its waters. Encircled, they remain islands. They are like the adventurers and explorers of old, who return from distant lands filled with new visions and experiences, to find that the world without them has remained exactly as they left it, and that friends and family can no longer understand them.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Flow of Time</h3> <div>Over the centuries, the fortunes of the Tamers of Rivers have ebbed and flowed like the waters of the seas. The Travelers, they say, were the first of the Elemental Masteries. Some even claim that they were the first of the Awakened. </div><div>The lore of the Travelers, passed down over eons, tells that once, the Mainland Peoples lived in peaceful, goddessworshiping matriarchal societies. Here, before there was any Quiescence, the Tamers of Rivers were highly respected. The first Tamers of Rivers were all women. Although they left the management of communities to the Grandmothers, their word carried a great deal of influence. They trained healers and midwives, moving from community to community as and when they were needed. </div><div>Sleeper historians, even those on the very edges, have lost the records of this caste. Even in the putative matriarchal societies suggested by radical historians, women stayed where they were. The evidence of the Travelers has gone, wiped out by the Quiescence and the machinations of the Exarchs. </div><div>The Atlanteans brought patriarchy to the Mainland. They sailed across the sea in their bright ships with painted sails, and they brought violence and control to the world. And they seized the Supernal Realms for their own, too. The Watchtowers were a means of control, the Travelers say, a means of keeping people out of the Supernal just as much as they were a means of access. Five obscene phallic monstrosities standing there, overlooking eternity, heralding the end of peace. As above, so below: the Atlanteans brought patriarchy to the world of humans and imposed the same patriarchy on the realms of magic. The Tamers of Rivers watched and wept, as all they had cared for fell before the ravening legions of conquest from the West. They felt no satisfaction as the harbingers of violent control overstretched themselves and destroyed their own home. </div><div>Still, the Quiescence hit the Tamers of Rivers hard. They still clung to their old ways, but without the fanfare, hiding among the midwives and healers who once had revered them and sat at their feet. Things change. The orders were the future of the Awakened, and eventually, the Elemental Masteries, including the Travelers, joined them. </div><div>The civilizations of the Middle East and the Mediterranean grew apace. The Tamers of Rivers, adapting as best they could to the new patriarchies and the mechanistic worldview they engendered, continued in the same traditional women’s roles. </div><div>Some joined the goddess-cults that remained, seeing in them the opportunity to gain some kind of respect. It was in this era that the first men joined the Legacy. These were eunuchs, male temple prostitutes and cup-bearers, the kind of men whose masculinity had been removed or violated, who were disenfranchised as men. </div><div>The age of the Greek city-states brought nautical trade to Europe, and allowed them to travel. The Peloponnesian War ended the era, but brought into being a need for the healing hands of the Tamers of Rivers. The common language and social upheaval brought by Philip and Alexander’s conquests and the Succession Wars made it easy to move from community to community across the Mediterranean and the Middle East, and again, the ravages of war meant that there was a constant need for healers, traders, teachers — and midwives. They rode the wave of the flourishing of art and literature of the Hellenistic era. </div><div>In time, Rome superseded the Hellenistic nations. The Pax Romana gave the Travelers more reason to travel. The rise of the mystery religions allowed the Tamers of Rivers unprecedented freedom. The priestesses of the Mysteries, of Cybele, the Eleusinian Cult and Isis, gave an Awakened woman the chance to cross great differences and gain a kind of tarnished respect in a world where women had little chance to travel or learn. Some took common cause with the Christians, who, during the days of their persecution, treated all of the disenfranchised — women, slaves, the conquered — with compassion and equality. Some of the Gnostics, particularly those who respected the Magdalene, Awakened. A large proportion joined the Travelers. By the time the Christians had gained the upper hand and had become the controlling religion of the Empire, they were no different from any other establishment religion. The sect that the Tamers of Rivers had favored was anathematized and wiped out. </div><div>The Empire ended in flames and humiliation, but the Tamers of Rivers continued. In the new world of the Middle Ages, their constant travel kept them safe in a world where few people ever went further than 20 miles from their homes. The Middle Ages allowed them to find new recruits from the outsiders of the world. </div><div>It goes on. They hid from the Church within the Church, at times taking on the part of nuns and saints. If some were hanged or drowned as witches, they hid well enough, and were few in number compared to the innocent Christians who were killed by mistake. </div><div>Tamers of Rivers traveled to the New World. They met others who had formed comparable traditions in the Americas, in Africa, in the Antipodes. </div><div>All the time, their numbers dwindled, slowly, inexorably, until the second half of the 18th century, when a sea change in Western philosophy and vast upheavals in the political landscape made people see themselves and each other differently. This created a vast potential for more change. The horrors of the 20th century changed the Tamers of Rivers. True, the emancipation of women in the Western world and the change of social mores that happened after the Second World War gave them more freedom, more chances to be part of Sleeper society, but the wars themselves gave them cause to fear. Two apocalypses, so close together. The loss of a whole generation of European men, and the loss of faith that followed, the loss of a social compass, the loss of a way forward, the death of compassion. And the Holocaust, the bomb. Suddenly progress and change sped up, and not for the good. </div><div>Many Tamers of Rivers are idealists. They truly believe that the world can be made that much better, if only enough people can be encouraged to change. But they also know that their vision is ultimately doomed to failure. </div><div>No matter what a Tamer of Rivers does, there’s always the suspicion in her heart of hearts that she’s on a highway to nothing, that the world is going to hell. The air’s getting warmer. There are holes in the sky. The waters are vanishing. The River’s running dry. </div><div>The Tamers of Rivers recruit the kind of people who have dreams of a better world. They want the compassionate people. They want women and men who are able to stand for the right of people to live and love and create. But these very people are the ones who can’t live in this world. Every day the news bombards them with tales of corporate excesses, armies of liberation resorting to torture, sweatshops and cola wars, the death of 1,000 children every day from hunger caused by negligence and war. The AIDS epidemic. Poverty in the developing world. Simple, plain selfishness. </div><div>As the world lurches forward to destruction, as the River, the Ocean, flows ever more sluggishly, clogged with oil, refuse and blood, the Tamers of Rivers struggle to keep their spirit. </div><div>The Travelers keep traveling. They keep fighting their corner, working their magic, trying to change what little they can, so that the Sleepers can survive unharmed. It’s the best they can do.</div> <h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2> <div>When Tamers of Rivers choose their pupils, it’s often a snap decision. Some Travelers decide they need pupils (perhaps they’re lonely; perhaps they just think it’s time). Others might not even contemplate teaching someone of their own until one day, they meet a mage whose very appearance transforms their lives, and pow, there they are with a pupil. However it works out, the pupil gets the choice to join, although by the time that her prospective tutor has even begun to explain to her who the Tamers of Rivers are, the pupil in all likelihood knows if she is destined to follow the flow of the River to its final outlet. An aspirant who wants to join the Legacy has to find a tutor, just like any other mage who joins a Legacy. The problem is that a mage who moves around as much as a Tamer of Rivers does can be very difficult to pin down. </div><div>There follows a period of purgation and cleansing. The Tamer of the River has to experience a letting-go of some aspects of her former life. She changes her name again. And she gives something up. Maybe it’s a home, or a treasured possession. Maybe it’s a relationship. </div><div>With all things stripped away, the Tamer of Rivers travels to a river with her tutor, and the more experienced mage helps her to undress. Naked, she enters the river. The tutor baptizes her, and holds her head under the water until she very nearly drowns. In the split second between living and entering into the afterlife, the new pupil becomes one with the River, with every watercourse in the world, with every sea, with every flow of blood and fluid in every living thing, all at once. She becomes the Water, and she becomes change. She becomes transformation. She bursts out of the water into the arms of her tutor, gulping in air, crying her heart into her tutor’s arms, having become something both other than human and more human than before. </div><div>She returns with the tutor, possessed of what feels like a new mind. New thoughts and new desires well up within her. She changes, becomes different in some way. The change might be physical. Her eyes could have changed color, from brown to blue. Maybe she’s thin where once she was overweight. The change could be in her social nature, in her desires. Perhaps her sexuality has changed. Maybe she needs to touch people when she speaks to them. The change could be mental. Perhaps she’s lost some of the memories of her childhood, replaced with memories of something older and stranger. Maybe her opinions of some people or things have changed utterly. Maybe there’s someone she once loved, whom now she has entirely forgotten. The core of her being hasn’t really changed: she still has the same Virtue and the same Vice, for example, and her soul is the same soul, only it’s a soul that knows it is one with the River. It’s a soul that embraces change and continuing travel. </div><div>She’s a Tamer of Rivers now. When it is time to gain a new Attainment, she returns to the water. Either she finds her tutor, and they do this again, or, having left her tutor behind — and it’s in the nature of a Traveler to move on — she goes into the water alone. Immersed in the River, she becomes more like the water each time. Each time, she moves on a little, and each time she has to give another thing up, maybe another memory, or a lover, or a home, maybe even a name. With each change, she begins again as a slightly different person. Neither the tutor or the pupil knows what the River’s going to take (although a Traveler with a degree of self-knowledge might be able to guess). That’s up to the River.</div>",
        "magic": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2> The Tamers of Rivers use water in all of their magics. This isn’t always obvious. In the philosophy of the Elemental Masteries, water is change, and the abstract theme of change is as prevalent as actual magic. There is water in the air, and water in the human body. Many Tamers of Rivers learns how to cast their instant spells by reaching into the water that permeates all things, even in some of the driest places in the world, and manipulating it, duplicating it by bonding atoms of hydrogen and oxygen, driving it, pushing it, changing it. The Travelers often use water in their extended castings in a more obvious way, using vials of purified water, homeopathic solutions and basins of fresh rain water to achieve the effects they look for.<div>Many Tamers of Rivers have familiars. Usually, they find an affinity with waterfowl, who travel across the world every year and understand the ways of the River. Many Tamers of Rivers seek out the Caladrius, the rare, near-mythical Healing-Bird, to give them company and aid.</div>",

For example, she can turn milk, which is water-based, into something that isn’t, like gasoline, and she can turn gasoline into orange juice, which is mostly water, but she can’t turn gasoline into mercury.

The water created by this Attainment is perfectly drinkable, and can be used as the focus of either the first or second Attainment.

As time went on, the buildings became more ornate, more impressive, more intricately designed. The Pyramids. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. The Temple of Zeus at Olympia. The Gates of Palmyra. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. The Colossus of Rhodes. The Hanging Gardens. The Lal Qila at Delhi. Machu Picchu. The Colosseum. The Great Wall of China. The Taj Mahal. St. Paul’s Cathedral. The Empire State Building. </div><div>The hands that built them were manifold. The architects may have been well-known, but the unsung thousands who actually made these grand structures were just as important. Theirs was not the inspiration. Theirs was not the design, theirs was not the grand conceit. Theirs was the craft. Theirs was the work of their hands, the honest toil, the skill and the sweat. </div><div>The Tamers of Stone were there. Although the self-styled “Craftmasons” have always trained their students to know the theory of design and the grand geometry of architecture, the Craftmasons have also instructed their own to get their hands dirty. The Awakened may have had no part in the design of the great architectural wonders of human history, but they were there in the act of building, and they were there in the building itself. They joined the common man on the ground. </div><div>The Tamers of Fire take the role of those born to lead. The Tamers of Rivers bring change and healing. The Tamers of Winds all distinguish themselves through their endless urge to know. But the Tamers of Stone blend in with the anonymous masses. All people are equal, the Craftmasons say. The Awakened have no right to treat the Sleepers as instruments, for they are as human as the Awakened. In these times, the Craftmasons represent and quietly protect the common man. </div><div>Humanity came from earth, and to earth every man and woman shall return. It’s the basis of human life. Earth is sensation: the stones know and recall every foot that walked across them, every hammer and chisel that worked them. The stones have stories to tell, if only one will have the patience to ask them. The Tamers of Stone understand this. They craft their souls to the extent that they perceive that they are earth, they are stone. And for them, stone is creation and perception. </div><div>For them, stone is incarnation in the flesh, the means by which the One God, Urizen, the Demiurge or whatever, pulled Adam out of the ground. Stone is humanity, the common thread that links all men together. </div><div>Earth is incarnation: the stones are solid. The stones survive when the fire has burnt out, when the flood has dried out, when the wind has passed away. The stones remain. The Tamers of Stone bring the solidity and quiet observation of the earth to the Elemental Masteries. The Craftmasons stand among the Sleepers, protecting them and serving them. Capable of magics both subtle and spectacular, the Tamers of Stone know the magic means nothing if they can’t play their part in human society. </div><div>The Sleepers are beset on all sides. Their cites are choked with the hungry, sneering dead, who prey on their blood, by shapeshifters, who tear them to shreds and dine on their flesh, by ghosts and spirits and demons and worse things and, most of all, by the other Awakened. The Tamers of Stone might care little for tales of cosmic struggles between Exarchs and Oracles, but the Craftmasons have no time for those who would exploit the Sleepers and keep them from Awakening. Apparently humble the Tamers of Stone may be, but as many would-be tyrants have discovered, the hand of the common man can be a powerful weapon.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Craftmasons",
        "orders": " The Tamers of Stone aren’t equally represented in the Pentacle. Some members of the Adamantine Arrow see a common cause with the Craftmasons, and seek to join their number, seeing the battle as vital. The Guardians of the Veil want to keep the Sleepers unaware of magic. They preserve their paranoid hierarchies and keep the magic under lock and key. They have no time for the Tamers of Stone, and few join, although, occasionally, there is the mage who sees the edifice the Guardians would build as a castle, not a prison. Members of the Mysterium, who seek knowledge above all, often find it hard to appreciate the Craftmasons’ obsession with the Sleepers. Can knowledge be found among ordinary people? Can knowledge be gained from getting your hands dirty? There are a very few Mysterium members for whom the answers to those questions are “yes,” and they are not hostile to the idea of joining the Tamers of Stone.<div>The Silver Ladder, on the other hand, supplies many of the Craftmasons’ pupils. The idealists who form a large part of the Silver Ladder’s membership see the Craftmasons’ ideals as completely in harmony with their own. The same goes for the Free Council, who include among their number craftsmen and political radicals, who see the soulcrafting of the Tamers of Stone as a simple continuation of their magical journey.</div>",

The nimbus of a Tamer of Stone appears to affect the area around him. The substance of common things might appear to take on life, or a personality. The Tamer of Stone’s skin might appear to develop the texture of roughly chiseled stone. Or he might appear to be an everyman, taking on the aspect of every human being alive, just for a second, from the lowest to the highest, provoking a moment of recognition in everyone.</div>",
        "background": " Tamers of Stone often come from workingclass or blue-collar backgrounds. Some have higher educational qualifications, but they still mostly come from technical and manual fields. As long as the mage is involved in manual labor of some kind, she’s welcome. The Tamers of Stone include among their number decorators, carpenters, glaziers, roofers, architects, civil engineers and farmers, but the vast majority of Tamers of Stone work in construction, and perform their magic within that context. The nature of their everyday work means that most Tamers of Stone are male, although there are no prohibitions against women joining the Legacy, and few prejudices among their number.",
        "organizzation": "The Tamers of Stone are the most organized of the Elemental Masteries. Since the Middle Ages, they’ve been loosely arranged into regional Lodges, which work together to support each other. Just as in all the Elemental Masteries, tutors approach potential pupils, particularly choosing bluecollar mages with a talent for manual craftsmanship. Although each pupil only has one tutor, members of each Lodge take part in the training of newer Tamers of Stone. The tutor-pupil relationship is the only relationship among the Craftmasons that admits any kind of hierarchy, and even then, tutors and pupils are notionally equal: the idea is that the tutor is not imparting knowledge from above, but sharing it from a position of experience, so that the pupil may one day be brought up to speed, with the purpose of effecting true equality among the Tamers of Stone.<div>In practice, however, people are people, and although the Tamers of Stone are supposed to be completely equal, many Lodges suffer from political machinations among their members, as each tries hard to be first among equals. </div><div>There are still a lot of Tamers of Stone. They’re a relatively numerous Legacy. Among the Elemental Masteries, only the Tamers of Rivers even come near them in numbers, and even then, they’re fewer. The Tamers of Stone are the blue-collar journeymen of the Elemental Masteries. Thus, the Craftmasons outnumber the others, many of whom (particularly the Tamers of Fire and Tamers of Winds) come from more privileged, educated backgrounds. </div><div>The Tamers of Stone work well with the other Elemental Masteries. Although the Tamers of Fire, with their heroic nature, can be autocratic, they often need a cause to be heroes for. Tamers of Stone who work in cabals alongside the Champions ground the Tamers of Fire and give them direction. Conversely, the Tamers of Rivers bring compromise to cabals that include Tamers of Stone. Like the constant flow of water eroding the rock, the Tamers of Rivers work to erode the sharp edges from the Craftmasons’ hard resolve and create something more harmonious. The Tamers of Winds often clash with the Tamers of Stone — the Craftmasons find the Tamers of Winds’ tendency to stand in judgment over others patronizing and elitist. Still, both Legacies recognize that they have a role to play and notwithstanding their reservations, they often work together and work together well, the straightforwardness of the Tamers of Stone complementing the more cerebral nature of their airy counterparts.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History and Culture</h2> <div>The Tamers of Stone began, just as all of the Elemental Masteries, as people who took on a role within society. The Tamers in Stone were the craftsmen who built, who carved the pediments, who erected the pillars, who kept the blocks of the Great Pyramid straight and flush. For the longest time, they were ignored, with few to represent them among the Awakened. The Tamers of Stone, who took their place among the workers, knew their place and joined them in humility and obscurity. </div><div>There were a lot of them. Some Legacies have never been all that numerous, but as Legacies go, the Tamers of Stone have always had the weight of numbers. </div><div>Over time, craftsmen developed guilds. The guilds took on their own character, and craftsmen took pride in their work. The craftsmen grew wealthy. The result was that the Tamers of Stone, who lived and worked their magics among those craftsmen, gradually became politicized. As time went on, they began to develop the view that all men, who came from the earth, were equal. Mages who retreated into their own shadow world found it easy to forget the worth of the Sleepers. But the Craftmasons, who spent their time among the Sleepers and who knew them as friends and family, could not discount them. An Awakened human being is still a human being, and the Tamers of Stone felt that they were doing well to remember it. </div><div>They fought for their truth. </div><div>They began to bear grudges. One particularly sore point concerns the fate of the Diggers. Between 1649 and 1650, carried along in the wake of the Civil War, several groups of the so-called True Levellers, a pacifist and anarchist movement, began to set up land-working communities on common land across England. Although John Lilburne, the founder of the Diggers, was a Sleeper, several Tamers of Stone were part of the movement and believed in its aims. Landowners and community leaders abhorred what they saw as an affront to public order (and a way for poor men to escape paying rent to the large landowners). The reprisals began almost immediately, and the Diggers were finished by 1651. Every time a colony of Diggers began, the authorities crushed it, sometimes with court actions, and mostly with actual violence. </div><div>Beneath this social conflict lay another, esoteric clash. The Tamers of Stone who had been part of this movement found themselves, as their Sleeper companions were dispersed, betrayed into the hands of the Seers of the Throne on every occasion. The Tamers of Stone never proved that the Guardians of the Veil were behind it, but circumstantial evidence — rumors, letters, entries in diaries — suggested that mages belonging to the Guardians of the Veil had sold the Tamers of Stone out, feeding information of their supposed allies’ activities to Seer spies. The Seers were always one step ahead of the Tamers of Stone. In England, hardly any got out of the 17th century alive, and although their numbers would grow again in later centuries, the English Tamers of Stone would never forget what had happened, long after the Guardians responsible, who had likely only betrayed their allies as a political expedient, had died out. </div><div>The 17th century was a turning point for the Tamers of Stone. After that time, they remained the most political of the Elemental Masteries, with a general philosophy that, unlike the others, extended beyond the crafting of souls. </div><div>In the 18th century, Tamers of Stone were present among the Radical Dissenters, and took part in the revolutions in France and the American colonies. They were there within the movement for slaves’ emancipation. In the 19th century, they fought on both sides of the American Civil War, with those on the side of the North fighting for the slaves, and those in the South fighting for independence. By the beginning of the 20th century, there were many Craftmasons who had taken to heart the ethos of the Socialist International, joining with labor movements and communist parties across Europe. Tamers of Stone took roles in post-revolutionary Russia. When the Communist dream ended, there were Tamers of Stone taking hammers to the Berlin Wall with the rejoicing thousands. </div><div>The socialist and communalist ideals of the Tamers of Stone have received several blows during the last two decades, particularly in Western Europe and the United States, but even so, they still exist and in large numbers. Wherever there are working men, there the Tamers of Stone are, mucking in.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Day Job</h3> <div>As mages go, the Tamers of Stone are exceptionally grounded in everyday life. </div><div>Mages who eschew close relationships with Sleepers are safer, but gradually, such mages forget what it was like to be a Sleeper. They lose their empathy with the Sleepers. The mages no longer see the Sleepers as really human in the way that the Awakened are. The Elemental Masteries in general and the Tamers in Stone in particular prefer to retain their ties, and in the case of the Craftmasons, this means holding down a day job, and doing it well. </div><div>Holding down a day job holds all kinds of complications for a mage. Many manage it, and do just fine. The Tamers of Stone depend upon it. They see remaining at work part of the work of taming their souls. </div><div>This can appear to be quite limiting for characters. Actually, it’s a rich vein of complication and plot devices, just waiting to be mined. </div><div>The building trade, where most of the Craftmasons work, can be quite peripatetic. Workers in years past used to travel to where the work was. While that doesn’t happen so much now, in some countries builders still move from town to town, taking on short-term construction work. A mage in this industry could be a valuable resource for a cabal, who could travel with him. The pay isn’t going to feed all the mouths, but it offers a grounding for a group who can move on when he does. Another mage could be a self-employed building contractor. His fellow mages could work within the trade alongside him, meaning that they all have a means of support and a reason to stick together. </div><div>Colleagues can produce all sorts of plot complications, mystical and mundane. Even building sites have their leaders, their bullies, their good guys, their slackers and their bosses. A place of work has a ready-made supporting cast with their own concerns, and their own lives. Maybe some of them get involved, unknowing in the mage’s “after-hours” life. What if one, entirely coincidentally, runs into his Awakened colleague and witnesses the mage doing vulgar magic? The co-worker might Disbelieve it, but there’s still that niggling doubt there, that suspicion that something is wrong. What if one of the mage’s work colleagues suddenly Awakens? What if she Awakens while at work? </div><div>Even if they don’t, the soap opera of the workplace can make a welcome change of pace from rampaging spirits, insane magical conspiracies and monstrous creatures of the night. Workplace romances, issues with pay, industrial action and personal clashes can make stories all the richer.</div> <h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2> <div>Tamers of Stone often choose their pupils, although the process of gaining a pupil is a little more involved than it is with some of the other Elemental Masteries, since a tutor who decides that he wishes to ask a pupil to join the Legacy (or wishes to accept an applicant) must first return to his Lodge and put it to the vote. </div><div>The Lodge members usually vote yes. It’s often, but not always, a foregone conclusion, since new members are always welcome, regardless of their apparent quality. The tutor approaches his prospective pupil and explains to him the Legacy’s philosophy and its practices in brief, giving the less experienced mage the opportunity to turn down the privilege, if finding out more has changed her mind. </div><div>The first stage of soulcrafting begins with a building. Under the tutor’s direction, the pupil must spend several days building a small edifice out of plaster and brick. Having completed it, he steps inside. And then the tutor bricks his pupil inside. The pupil has to leave the building behind. He exercises his affinity with the earth and with the dimensions of the earth. He speaks to it. He perceives it from every angle. And then he becomes the earth. </div><div>What follows is impossible. The mage folds himself into the earth and, having succeeded in escaping, draws himself to his feet behind the building, leaving the brick coffin undisturbed. It’s a feat that a mage shouldn’t be able to do until he’s at least an Adept of Space, and yet, just once, the mage over-reaches himself, and transforms himself into stone and incarnation. </div><div>On the occasion that he gains each subsequent Attainment, the trainee Craftmason makes a new escape from a similar conundrum. Each time he gains a new insight into the nature of the earth: he is the earth. He is the ground. Each time, to escape, he perceives that and folds himself through his own body , turning himself inside out and remaking his soul in the process.</div>",
        "magic": "<h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2> <div>The magic of the Tamers of Stone depends upon craftsmanship. It’s worked and perfected. Craftmason rotes are finely polished, ornately devised tools, with the beauty and practical application of a well-balanced hammer. </div><div>They favor spells that extend the senses (the stones see and hear all that comes to pass without comment; the stones are present in all great events) and spells that work with solid, constant matter (the stones abide; the stones remain). </div><div>Conversely, they excel in magics that deal with the flesh and sensation.

The effect of this Attainment works as the Space 1 “Finder” spell, cast as using Space 2 (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 233), and limited to places, although the mage’s affinity with the earth means that following the lines to a Hallow, even one completely unknown, is easy, no matter how obscure it might be.  </div><div>This same affinity with the earth allows a mage to detect magical resonance in any place, which is similar to the effect of the Prime 1 “Supernal Vision” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 221) when applied to a physical place.  </div><div>As any Tamer of Stone will tell you, finding a Hallow anywhere in the world is easy.

If the truth is captured and hidden in a box, it ceases to be the truth. </div><div>Still, if a magician is subtle enough, if he is sensible enough, he can glimpse the truth, just for a moment, fingers holding the air just long enough for that split-second of enlightenment before letting it go. </div><div>You can hold the winds in a bag, but you have to let them free eventually, if you’re going to get any use out of them. And they’re only winds if you open the bag. Before that, they’re just air. Enlightenment is like that. Capturing it is all well and good, but at some point it has to be shared. </div><div>Appreciating enlightenment allows control over the physical air. Air, in the philosophical parlance of the Elemental Masteries, is the same as enlightenment. Air is reason. Air is knowledge. The mage who perceives that his soul can become the Air gains mastery over the weather and might even be able to defy gravity. That’s Taming the Winds. </div><div>The mages who have, over the centuries, made this their pursuit meditate on the glimpses they receive of the truth. Glimpses of the truth are preserved in memory. Memory is the ground on which thought builds itself. The Tamers of Winds have always grown thought from memory. Except that memory is a different thing to what it once was. </div><div>Since the invention of the gramophone, the camera and the film reel, humans have had the ability to record facts as they happen. Suddenly, human memory has been made inadequate, superseded by simple technology. In the space of 100 years, facts became prevalent over truth in a million different ways. </div><div>The invention of instant recording changed the human psyche more thoroughly than any other invention. The Tamers of Winds are in a unique position. Their soulcrafting is of the same stripe as the soulcrafting of the ancients, but the practitioners of the Legacy, being mortal, have all been born into a world where these things exist. They have the psychological makeup of people who take cameras, video and sound recording for granted. The result is that the Tamers of Winds exist in a strange kind of tension. On the one hand, they have always known that the facts don’t necessary hold the truth, and might in fact obscure the truth. On the other hand, they’re of a generation that takes without question recording media as the refinement of memory. </div><div>The truth will out, they say. The Tamers of Winds are counting on that. There are Tamers of Winds who seek the truth through the media, aiming to capture small truths perfectly through the medium of film and sound. There are Tamers of Winds who work in law, who seek the truth from human accounts. There are others who work their magic through symbolic truth, using literature of various kinds as their conduit. Others still work as journalists, either professionally for newspapers and magazines, or as simple recorders of facts for the mystical orders they work for. And then there are Tamers of Winds who work in neurology and the field of cybernetics, whose intent is to do nothing less than improve the human brain, to create a perfect memory, not just for facts, but for the truth.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Aeolians",
        "orders": "Many Tamers of Winds have their origins in the Free Council, particularly those Tamers who have no problem working magic through technology. The Mysterium, too, an order of truthseekers, finds the Tamers of Winds attractive and gains a great deal from the association.<div>Some of the Silver Ladder’s more progressive members are drawn to seek the Tamers of Winds out, attracted by the dream of knowledge for all. While the Aeolians hold no especial attraction for the Adamantine Arrow, there is no real reason why an Arrow would not  join the Tamers of Winds either, and certainly, several prominent Tamers of Winds have come from the Arrows. </div><div>The Guardians of the Veil, however, don’t tend to find the Tamers of Winds an attractive option. The Tamers of Winds make all this noise about seeking the truth, but they’re not careful whom they show it to. Making the truth public to everyone, Sleeper and Awakened, terrifies and angers the Guardians of the Veil. As a result, very few Tamers of Winds come from the Guardians of the Veil.</div>",
        "appearance": " Most Tamers of Winds dress smartly, but then most are professionals, holding down professional jobs, and they look the part. No matter how they’re dressed, smart or  scruffy, Aeolians as if they’re looking for something. Their eyes move around, assessing their surroundings. <div>The Elemental Mark that changes their nimbus carries with it the twin markers of inpiration and air. It might be that a powerful wind comes from nowhere. It might be that the smell of ozone suddenly fills the area around the Aeolian’s body.</div>",
        "background": " The Tamers of Winds used to come in large numbers from the priestly castes in ancient societies. In history, the churches of different civilizations have been the keepers of truth — and the keepers of the money. In the West, the tradition continued with the Christian churches, who owned huge amounts of land in Europe. In the last couple of hundred years, that’s changed, as the money has moved from the priestly to the professional.  <div>Many Aeolians are educated professionals, particularly in fields that require inquiry and investigation: science and technology, law, law enforcement, theology and philosophy, and journalism are particularly common professions among the Tamers of Winds.</div>",
        "organizzation": "When a Tamer of Winds sees someone he wants to teach, he sends the prospective pupil a long document. Traditionally, it was handwritten. Now, it is just as likely to be typed, or even put on a DVD or CD. The document tells the pupil why the tutor is offering this  opportunity, what the Legacy has to offer and what the difficulties are. The document has no return address, and is unsigned. Voices and pictures on audio or video media are doctored to hide identities.  <div>It’s up to the pupil to find the sender. Only then can she reach the point of initiation. A potential pupil who wants to join the Legacy, on the other hand, and who approaches a member of the Legacy, usually has to pass a test. It might involve finding some hidden fact that has escaped the tutor for years. Or it might mean that the aspirant has to find something out about the tutor that has been hidden for a long time.  </div><div>Once initiated into the Legacy, the new Tamer of Winds only really has an obligation to her tutor. The Tamers of Winds take the tutor-pupil relationship very seriously and work very closely. Most correspond at least once a day. Just as with the other Elemental Masteries, the Tamers of Winds theoretically have a duty to provide aid to those who carry the Elemental Mark, but in practice, although they might be well disposed toward other Tamers, they’re not really obliged to support them.  </div><div>Tamers of Winds work well with some of the Elemental Masteries. The Tamers of Winds’ endless search for the truth leads them to fan the flames of the Tamers of Fire and to stir the Tamers of Rivers to action and change. The Tamers of the Cave confuse the Tamers of Wind, however. The few Tamers of Winds who meet a Tamer of the Cave find these prophets of the Void to be impossible to understand: their truth is so vague, so inchoate that it is barely comprehensible to the Tamers of Wind.  </div><div>The Tamers of Stone annoy the Tamers of the Wind. The Aeolians would see humans raised to a higher level, given a gift of truth through perfect memory. The Tamers of Winds sometimes get the impression that the Tamers of Stone would rather drag the world down to their level. Still, as members of the Elemental Masteries, the Tamers of Winds still recognize their commonality, although things may change, as the Tamers of Winds go further down the road to perfected memory.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History and Culture</h2> <div>In the very beginning, the Tamers of Winds were the controllers of weather, priests of the sky who could blight or prosper crops. Although given over to the Air, that most mobile of elements, the use of their weather magic encouraged farming, and hence staying in place. As they developed into an institutional priesthood, they began also to record lore. They wrote some of the first histories, and began to promote the arts as a means of teaching. </div><div>It became apparent to these first Tamers of Winds that the truth of history, psychology and philosophy was a slippery thing, not unlike the wind. Similar to the rest of the Elemental Masteries, the Tamers of Winds believed that truth, knowledge and the wind were literally one and the same. They crafted their souls to exploit that “fact,” becoming wind, becoming knowledge, becoming truth. </div><div>As things got worse for the other mages after the Fall, the Aeolians retreated into academia, becoming lorekeepers, priests and librarians. They promoted literacy, traveled little and kept the winds from destroying their homes. They retreated into the shadow world of the mages, joining the orders, particularly the Mysterium. </div><div>And so they remained, for thousands of years, until the Enlightenment. The great truths changed then, and human politics transformed itself. In Europe, the Tamers of Winds, without really trying, changed the way they thought, the same way that everyone else did. But in the 19th century, everything changed.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Facts and Truths</h3> <div>Until the invention of instant recording media, all history depended upon human hands and human memories. History books were written by those who recorded accounts of what people recalled. </div><div>Memory was fallible. Everyone knew memory was fallible. It was a world in which four contradictory Gospels could be included in the Bible, and all of them thought to be true, because truth wasn’t supposed to be about immutable facts. </div><div>Truth was about eternal verities, regardless of facts. Facts were just things that happened, and that people remembered and forgot. It was supposed to be about what was true. Truth went beyond simple facts. To the historians of ancient Greece, something didn’t have to have happened in order to be true. Herodotus and Thucydides gave accounts of great speeches that were never given, but that were no less a true encapsulation of the great statesmen’s positions. Livy rewrote the early history of Rome from hearsay and dimly remembered oral traditions, choosing those facts that he regarded as true because they fit what he believed the order of things should be. </div><div>Facts and truth were not the same, and both were impossible for fallible humans to capture. Throughout the ages, the past was only a matter of memory, of hearsay and opinion. Although, when the Age of Reason arrived, the great thinkers of the day tried to deny this, claiming that facts could be nailed down, they tried in vain. </div><div>And then, in 1826, Nicéphore Niépce invented the first photographic plate. When, eight years later, Louis Daguerre patented the daguerreotype, the history of thought changed. Suddenly, people could capture a moment, as it was, with only the light and the chemicals on the photographic plate as intermediaries. </div><div>In 1877, Edison patented the phonograph, and now words could recorded as they were said. A few years later, the movie camera appeared. And in the 1920s, film and sound were brought together. </div><div>Suddenly, the actions of people could be recorded. Suddenly, facts could be captured, and memory did not need to be relied upon. </div><div>During the course of the 20th century, facts and truth became conflated, a dangerous business in a world where propaganda was an art form. </div><div>The Tamers of Winds found themselves just as fascinated by these new technologies as everyone else. Cameras and film gave the Tamers of Winds factual material from which to find truth. To their frustration, truths became just as elusive, and were still locked in the human soul. </div><div>Facts are easy to find, but facts can be untrue. Facts can obscure more important things. The truth doesn’t always out.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Bleeding Edge</h3> <div>Some Tamers of Winds have entered the field of neurology and cybernetics. They’re convinced that if human memory can be “fixed,” humanity can become more perfect, more whole. </div><div>Aeolian researchers have made breakthroughs in the use of drugs and hypnosis, but they have not yet found that holy grail, the means of making memory perfect. </div><div>There are rumors of institutions run by Aeolians, whose desire to fix people has led them to magically experiment — even operate — on Sleepers’ brains, not always with their consent. </div><div>Like attracts like. The Aeolians are truth, and seek to find truth, no matter how it’s recorded.</div> <h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2> <div>When a potential Tamer of Winds finally figures out where his invitation to join came from, his tutor takes him to a high outdoors area, where they are unlikely to be disturbed — a cliff top, for example, or the roof of a tall building. A period of guided meditation in the company of the tutor encourages the potential Aeolian to enter a trance state. And then the tutor makes her jump. </div><div>The question of whether she literally jumps or not is never settled. The Tamers of Wind do not allow recording equipment of any kind. The pupil feels the rush of air, the impact of the ground, the crush of bones — and then she wakes up, still sitting in the high place, where she was before she jumped. </div><div>Did she dream it? Did she jump? If she did, how did she get back here? She has an epiphany. She jumped and she did not jump, and both are true statements. She is a Tamer of Winds now, and she is wind, and she is truth. </div><div>Not everyone makes it through the initiation. Every so often, though, there’s a rumor of an Acanthus mage who leaps off a tall building and ends up a smear on the sidewalk. </div><div>The second and third Attainments of the Wind depend upon further initiations. Both involve paradoxes, things that didn’t happen and yet which happened while the mage was in a guided trance. One Aeolian starves to death and feels himself eaten by crows. One feels his tutor’s knife twisting between his ribs. Each time, the epiphany of truth in paradox is enough to cross the mage over the threshold of the next Attainment.</div>",
        "magic": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2> <div>The magic of the Tamers of Winds controls manifestations of the Air, both the elemental force and the truth it can sometimes be. On the one hand, the Aeolians are the masters of the Air, controlling the wind and the rain in ways that other mages can only imagine. </div><div>The other side of the Aeolians’ magic is that which seeks truth. Tamers of Wind are masters of creating magics that investigate the truth of a thing. </div><div>The Tamers of Wind cast both kinds of magic swiftly. They favor short castings and make heavy use of rote mudras (see Mage: The Awakening,  p. 125): the air does not wait, they say. Having said that, when ritual or extended castings become necessary, the Tamers of Winds prefer to be outside: like attracts like. They are open Air, and the open Air calls to them. Their castings, similar to all of the Elemental Masteries’ spells, often use the paraphernalia of standard occultism, although the Tamers of Winds also use gadgets, particularly cameras and video cameras, as tools in their magic.</div>",

        "thirdAttainmentOptDescrizione": "The Tamer of Winds who is also an Adept of Mind can now extend his control of the air, and his control of truth into the minds of others, giving them a remarkable degree of clarity — or making them believe anything he tells them. His truth becomes their truth. The Aeolian just has to speak to his target for the power to take effect. Maybe he’s gently persuasive. Maybe he’s seductive. Maybe he comes up with an amazing piece of propaganda. The effect is similar to the Mind 4 “Breach the Vault of Memory” spell (see Mage: The Awakening,  p. 214). The player rolls Presence + Persuasion + Mind, and the target reflexively contests with Composure + Gnosis. If the mage is successful, the target’s memory changes subtly. The minute alteration of the subject’s experiences and the things the subject knows  about the world allow the mage to make the subject believe whatever he wants her to believe, if only for a short while."

        "descrizione": "<div>At the dawn of known civilization, when Atlantis had long since passed into legend, Sleepers still knew that some men worked miracles. They chained the storm-wind in their bellows to send it roaring into the furnace. Kissed by the fire’s ardor, dull ore sweated drops of shining metal. The smith shaped this metal with hammer and tongs, and then quenched it in water. A hundred useful things came from the forge: barrel-hoops and buckles, pins and plowshares. The smith knew the secrets of shining silver and heart-gladdening gold, the soft service of copper, tin and lead and the resilience of bronze. Most of all, though, he knew the secrets of iron. Not a pretty metal, but a strong one; the perfect metal for the swords and armor that made one man master over his fellows — and it fell from the sky. </div><div>Around the world, therefore, common folk and kings saw the smith as a figure of magic — because, of course, he was. Long before Egypt, Sumer or China, the mages of Atlantis wrought wonders in their forges of power. Smith-gods such as Greek Hephaistos, Celtic Goibniu or Yoruban Ogoun preserve a faint memory of their deeds. The mortal smiths remembered, too. They knew their Art revealed a sacred, Supernal truth: in creating tools, the smith did more than change the substance or shape of matter. He imbued matter with purpose , making it an extension of human thought and human will. This metaphysical change was at least as great and wonderful a miracle as the production of metal from ore. </div><div>In the modern age of factories and mass production, most people forget the awe that once surrounded the Masters of Metal. The miracles have become too commonplace. A few people keep the old ways and the old secrets, though — sometimes in the very heart of the industrial world that seems to have surpassed the wonder-smiths of yore. These Awakened few know that humanity has not yet laid bare all the secrets of metal. Indeed, some of these Forge Masters believe the golden age of their Legacy has not yet come.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Powersmiths",
        "orders": " The Forge Masters have a long association with the Adamantine Arrow, forging magical weapons, armor and shields for their battles. Arrow members sometimes join the Legacy so they can design and forge their own armaments. The Mysterium takes a more esoteric approach to the Legacy.<div>The metaphysical transformation of matter into tool fascinates some of these Arcane scholars; others strive to reconstruct the techniques by which ancient mages crafted magical wonders. </div><div>The Free Council, however, now claims the largest number of the Forge Masters. Libertine Powersmiths take great pride in the ancient roots of modern metallurgy. Legacy members combine ancient craftsmanship with new alloys, or apply new metal-shaping technologies to the crafting of Enchanted  Items. A few Obrimos Libertines have  become Forge Masters, but the order’s capacity to spread the Legacy is very  new and very  rare as yet. </div><div>The Silver Ladder and Guardians of the Veil readily use the products of this Legacy’s labors, whether to chastise a rebellious spirit or murder someone for looking where he shouldn’t. Neither order has much in common with the Legacy’s own interests, though. </div><div>The Seers of the Throne include a few Forge Masters. Makers of weapons and tools have always served power, and the Seers pay as well as — better than — any warlord, chief or king. The Seers’ Powersmiths initiate their own apprentices and have little contact with their counterparts in the Pentacle.</div>",
        "appearance": "Forge Master practices involve a great deal of physical exertion, so there are no weaklings in the Legacy. Young or old, slim or fat, they have broad shoulders and a powerful grip.<div>While working at the forge, a Powersmith wears heavy leather gloves and a heavy leather apron that reaches from his shoulders to his knees. This protects him against sparks and the forge’s heat. He also wears a patch over one eye, so an accident cannot blind him completely. Forge Masters often tool their eyepatch with a personal symbol, as a sort of badge of office. Even when they aren’t working, Forge Masters usually prefer simple, sturdy clothing. For some Powersmiths, it’s almost a  mark of pride to show up at Consilium meetings and other formal occasions dressed in spark-scorched denim and leather while everyone else is in their “Sunday best.” Forge Masters who prefer jewelry work usually dress more upscale; the two factions rib each other over their fashion sense.</div>",
        "background": "Traditionally, blacksmiths are men. A few women join the Powersmiths, but they all have trouble finding masters willing to initiate them. Even Forge Masters who are not actively chauvinistic may wonder if a woman has the upper-body strength for the work, so female members find themselves working twice as hard for half the respect. <div>In many parts of the Third World, blacksmiths still practice their trade as a regular part of village culture. Any man who Awakens as a Moros soon learns about the Forge Masters as a career option. Any blacksmith who Awakens is expected  to join the Forge Masters, whether he’s a Moros or not, though no one actually forces the choice on a mage. </div><div>In the developed world, old-fashioned blacksmithing is now just an unusual hobby, so few Forge Masters were actual smiths before they Awakened. Instead, they tend to be engineers, machinists, factory workers and other people who work with metal for a living or as part of a hobby. Other Moros become interested in the Legacy because they want to create magical tools or wonders, and the Forge Masters know a lot about this. The Legacy keeps a strong working-class feel, though.</div>",
        "organizzation": " The Forge Masters place great stock in the relationship of master to apprentice, and show little concern for organization beyond that. If the Powersmiths in a region are numerous enough, (more than three or four), they may declare themselves a “guild,” but no one takes these groups too seriously. <div>Forge Masters like to gather when a mage joins the Legacy or achieves a new Attainment. In some cultures, the guild marks these occasions with a solemn ceremony. In the developed world, the gathered Powersmiths usually limit the ceremony to drinking the member’s health, and then just drinking. </div><div>Members of this Legacy enjoy teasing each other a great deal. Powersmiths who possess college degrees are apt to be called “Professors” by members who don’t. The blacksmiths affect to look down on the smiths who work in “weaker” metals such as tin or precious metals, while the jewelers snub the “uncouth tradesmen” who work in base metals. It’s all in good fun, though. Usually.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2> <div>The Forge Masters don’t keep much history; or rather, they say their history consists of the things they made, not the people who made them. The Legacy’s lore is mostly oral and practical: how to recognize different alloys, how long to heat particular ores, different styles of metalwork and who used them. The great Powersmiths of the past are known through the items they enchanted and the personal hallmarks they stamped on their work. The Forge Masters know their Legacy is very old, though, because it occurs wherever people smelt metal from ore. </div><div>In Atlantis, the Forge Masters say, their Legacy did not exist as such. Matter responded to enlightened Will. All mages could do all things if they chose. Some mages simply developed greater skill at working with metal — and those mages wrought wonders. They also discovered the perfected metals such as orichalcum and lunargent. Some Atlantean artifacts suggest a half-technological magic of devices built from crystals and perfected metals: flying ships powered by sorcerous engines, weapons that fired lightning bolts from crystal rods and many other strange devices. </div><div>When the warring Atlanteans broke the world, the wondersmiths lost their greatest powers. The arts that remained to them, however, seemed mighty enough to simple Sleepers. The Atlanteans and their heirs still wrought wonders that mythology would ascribe to gods and demigods, such as the dwarf-forged hammer Mjollnir, or the maidens of living gold who served Hephaistos. </div><div>As magic faded from the world, the heirs of Atlantis had to re-invent their spells and rely more on mundane artifice. Nevertheless, their power remained great enough that even Sleeper smiths were treated as magicians — and similar to all magicians, the smiths inspired fear and contempt as well as awe and respect. In many cultures, blacksmith families were deemed of royal or even godly descent. In just as many other cultures, blacksmiths were suspected of knowing curses or called unclean for the sweat and grime of their profession. </div><div>Many of the rotes known to Forge Masters reflect this mythic age. Powersmiths sometimes ascribe their techniques of enchantment to divine smiths such as Hephaistos or Ogoun, the dwarf-smith Alberich and the faerie-smith Wayland or legendary mortals such as Daedalus or Tubalcain. The Forge Masters can point to more than myths, however, as evidence of their presence in the ancient world. Etruscan goldwork, for instance, is sometimes covered with nearly microscopic gold granules somehow soldered on without melting them. A temple in India holds a huge pillar of rustproof cast iron made in a time and place when supposedly neither iron-casting nor rustproof alloys were known. </div><div>Medieval blacksmiths lost a lot of prestige. More of them worked for common people, making everyday tools and implements. Armor and weapons became specialized crafts with their own practitioners. On the other hand, workers in silver and gold such as Cellini became famous as individuals for the first time. The Forge Masters lost prestige among fellow mages, too. </div><div>Perhaps the most momentous change, however, came when blacksmiths started making precision machines. The techniques developed for articulated suits of armor also enabled smiths to craft mechanical toys for royal patrons — or the first clocks driven by pendulums or springs — and from there, Forge Masters tell their apprentices, it was only a short step to steam engines. Powersmiths didn’t invent the new technologies — some may have been involved in particular inventions but their names are forgotten — but these mages accepted them gladly. Some Forge Masters still specialize in magical machines such as clockwork bodies for spirit familiars to possess, or Arcane seismographs that detect magical disruptions from far away. </div><div>The modern Forge Masters regret the modern world’s hostility to willworking, but not much. Nowadays, they have dozens of metals to combine for just the right alloy, and techniques for shaping metal their mythic forebears could never imagine. The Legacy has its traditionalists who insist a real blacksmith knows when to temper steel by the color of the cooling metal, not a thermometer. Most Powersmiths say, however, that the true artisan always surpasses his tools — especially when the art is magic. They seek to tame the refractory hardness of tungsten, the lightness of magnesium and beryllium and even the sinister weight of depleted uranium. What magic lurks within the new metals and manufacturing techniques? They don’t know — but they want to find out.</div> <h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2> <div>The Forge Masters are completely decentralized. They have no offices beyond tutor and pupil. Even their “guilds” are so informal they barely exist. In the Western world at least, no Powersmith has the authority to gainsay another’s judgment about how to train an apprentice or when to bring another mage into the Legacy. By the same token, the Legacy has no serious internal divisions: clashes between members stay personal. </div><div>Less accomplished Forge Masters do show respect for smiths who have progressed further in the Legacy; that’s just good sense. After all, you may need the senior Powersmith’s help to gain your next Attainment, if something happens to your current tutor. More experienced Forge Masters also know trade secrets they may impart if suitably flattered (and a little tipsy). </div><div>Titles are similarly informal. Tutor and pupil are generally called master and apprentice, regardless of their Arcana proficiencies. Once a pupil receives his first Attainment, other Powersmiths may address him as “journeyman” until he achieves his second Attainment. Forge Masters often assume the names of mythical or legendary smiths such as Sindri (the dwarf who forged Thor’s hammer Mjollnir) or Hua Kuang Fo (the Chinese god of silversmiths and goldsmiths). Personal ancestors who worked with metal are another common choice. </div><div>In other parts of the world, Forge Masters and their guilds may behave more formally. Some cultures still believe in magic and the blacksmith’s special status. In West Africa, for instance, blacksmiths sometimes belong to secret societies devoted to Ogoun (or similar gods). A society that claims a Forge Master as its leader gains great prestige, and Forge Masters themselves show great respect for members with higher Attainments. West African Forge Masters learn a copious body of myths, secret passwords and symbols as they advance from Attainment to Attainment. These secrets include spells and rotes, the names of spirits that may assist or hinder their work and legends about great Forge Masters. All in all, West African Powersmiths take their guilds and ranks quite seriously. </div><div>Whatever their culture, however, the Forge Masters keep a distinctly working-class attitude and sympathies. They do not try to isolate themselves from the common people. Even in places where blacksmith clans claim descent from ancient kings, Forge Masters still work for a living. In West Africa, for instance, the Ogoun societies have become significant advocates for the common people against political or tribal elites — which puts the local Forge Masters in conflict with mages who cultivate the local ruling classes. </div><div>Powersmiths in the developed world seldom entangle themselves in politics, either among Sleepers or the local Consilium: tutors often advise their pupils that every other mage is a potential client, so it’s best to stay neutral and sell to everyone. Most mages accept the Forge Masters’ neutrality. Not all mages respect the Legacy, though. Mages who get caught up in the “few and the proud” elitism of being Awakened find the Powersmiths disgracefully common and close to the Sleepers. Such attitudes are perhaps most frequent among the Guardians of the Veil and the worst elements of the Silver Ladder, which exist for domination and control, but every order has its snobs.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Powersmiths Among the Seers</h3> <div>Powersmiths, whatever their culture of origin, generally get along with each other. Let two Forge Masters meet and soon they’re talking shop. This amity does not extend to Forge Masters among the Seers of the Throne. Parallel lines of Powersmith initiation have existed among the Seers for as long as the Seers themselves — and the two sides do not mix. Forge Masters of the Pentacle think of their Seer counterparts as social climbers who’ve chosen the safety of patronage instead of honest work. </div><div>The Seers’ Powersmiths agree. They do have secret arts that place them above the masses. They do serve power. Similar to the legendary wonder-smiths of old, the Seers’ clients are gods, or at least the representatives of gods. They are spiritual kin to the true kings of this world. If other Forge Masters choose to disgrace that divine heritage by grubbing among the common herd, so much the worse for them. </div><div>The two factions loathe each other. Pentacle Forge Masters may stay neutral in Consilium politics, but most are happy to supply arms and armor for attacks upon the Seers.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Power of Iron</h3> <div>For centuries, Western scientists doubted that stones and metal fell from the sky, but ancient peoples knew this perfectly well. The Sumerian word for iron loosely translates as “starstone,” and the Greek “siderite” has the same meaning. The metal from the sky obviously came from the gods and so was used for sacred blades; bits of iron were set in gold like jewels. Even after the Hittites learned to smelt iron, meteoric iron retained special value because of its celestial origin — plus, iron didn’t rust, a property now ascribed to its nickel content. </div><div>For thousands of years, mortal blacksmiths could not actually liquefy iron. They charged their furnaces with ore and charcoal. Weeks later, they pulled out a spongy mass of iron still mixed with sand, slag and other bits of mineral that wouldn’t burn away. The smith had to hammer these impurities out of the hot metal. </div><div>Blacksmiths thought the spongy iron looked like a plant, so they called it a “bloom.” Every iron-working culture developed the same conceit: iron, and other metals, slowly grew in the earth as a refinement or perfection of common stone. The heat of the furnace accelerated this growth into a higher and purer form; the furnace itself was a man-made womb where the generation of life took place. By speeding the work of nature, surely the smelter had worked magic — or even seized the fire of divinity itself. </div><div>Iron’s new birth within the furnace did little to reduce the awe attached to the metal from the stars. Homer contrasted “democratic iron” with the bronze of aristocrats’ weapons and armor — but no one ever imagined that bronze would kill spirits or bring luck. Iron retains its mythic role as a symbol of strength and power: no soldier ever received the Titanium Cross. </div><div>Indeed, modern Powersmiths say that science reveals greater depths to iron’s mythic power. Iron is the death of suns: the fusion process that powers stars ends when it reaches iron. </div><div>Building heavier elements consumes energy instead of releasing it. Every element heavier than iron (including the other six mystic metals) is generated when a massive star dies in a supernova explosion, building heavier atoms from the iron in its dead core. One such supernova sparked the creation of the solar system, though, and iron from that dead star enables blood to carry oxygen. </div><div>Some Forge Masters give iron a different primacy. Iron nails held Christ to the Cross. Through the iron of Calvary, a single death led to life eternal. These mages would not deny the stellar significance of iron; seeing connections between theology and astrophysics is just part of being Awakened. </div><div>Whatever their faith, Forge Masters see iron as the greatest of metals. It is the metal of life and death conjoined. Iron gives humanity dominion over nature, and enslaves them to other men. Iron is power itself.</div>",
        "magic": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2> <div>The Forge Masters see toolmaking as an innately magical act — the first magic, in fact, practiced long before Atlantis. A tool consists of more than its form and substance. A tool has purpose. Mages can detect that purpose, too, in the form of resonance. Forge Masters believe that when mages enchant objects, they build upon that resonance.</div> <h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Arcana</h3> <div>By the nature of their Legacy, Forge Masters must study Matter and Prime: Matter for changes of form and substance, and Prime for imbuements of power. Of course, they do not limit themselves to those Arcana. All Arcana have value for the spells a Forge Master can imbue into an item, but a few have special value for helping them do their job. </div><div>Fate can link a tool or weapon to a specific person: the item knows its proper owner and does not grant its power to anyone else. More ominously, Forge Masters can create weapons fated to slay particular creatures — or people. The wonders from a Powersmith’s forge may also carry curses that fall upon people who wield them for improper ends. </div><div>Forces can amplify the impact of a weapon. Once upon a time, Powersmiths forged flaming swords and lightning-javelins for heroes to wield in their battles. Such enchantments are still known; the Paradoxes these weapons attract make them less useful than in days of yore. Forge Masters often study Forces, however, to protect themselves from the terrible heat of their furnaces and the metal they shape. Some ancient recipes for wonder-smithing require the use of an erupting volcano as a forge, as if the Powersmith were Hephaistos himself. </div><div>Spirit, however, is probably the Arcanum most valued by Forge Masters, outside of their Path and Legacy. They don’t care much about spirits per se  (though a few Powersmiths craft fetish items or treat with spirits of mining, smelting or craftsmanship), but Powersmiths need this Arcanum to create orichalcum, lunargent and the other perfected metals they use in their finest work.</div> <h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Perfected Metals</h3> <div>Mortals can speed the work of nature by refining ore into metal; mages can go a step further and smelt away the grosser aspects of matter. These “perfected” metals are closer to the Platonic essence of metal-ness, and therefore accept enchantment more easily. </div><div>Ordinary metals are perfected by repeatedly sending them into Twilight as ephemera and pulling them back to material form. (Some mages think this is the true meaning of the ancient alchemical formula, “Dissolve and coagulate.”) Perfecting a metal requires at least two dozen such passages back and forth. The final product has a tenth the volume and mass of the original stock of metal. Only the seven metals known to antiquity can be perfected: gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead and mercury. </div><div>Perfected gold, or orichalcum , has a redder hue than pure but mundane gold. Orichalcum seems to catch and hold light in its translucent depth, giving it a warm, fiery glow. Similar to mundane gold, orichalcum can be drawn into incredibly fine wires and beaten into leaf. Even the fiercest mundane acid cannot dissolve orichalcum. </div><div>Lunargent, or perfected silver, is likewise translucent and holds a cool, slightly blue glow. Lunargent, too, is highly malleable and chemically inert. </div><div>Perfected mercury, or hermium,  combines great density with a glittering silver gleam and perfect fluidity. In fact, hermium has the same “superfluid” properties as liquid helium: hermium can creep over the rim of a vessel to collect in a lower vessel,  stir hermium and the current circles forever. Hermium flows through the smallest opening with no friction at all. </div><div>Perfected copper, tin and lead are considerably less well-known to mages and have fewer known uses. The Forge Masters, however, esteem siderite  — perfected iron — above all other metals. Siderite is the strongest, toughest metal of all. It can bend like rubber and spring back into shape without the slightest trace of metal fatigue. Siderite holds an edge that never dulls. It cuts diamond and the finest mundane steel. Siderite doesn’t look special, though; its gray gleam may glitter a bit more than ordinary iron or steel, but nothing about it looks magical to the untrained eye. Meteoric iron is half-perfected already: it takes just one dozen passes through Twilight to become true siderite. </div><div>The perfected metals do not have active magical powers of their own. If a mage enchants an item made of perfected metal, however, his player receives a +1 equipment bonus to all the rolls to cast the necessary spells. Each metal has its own mystic affinities, apart from physical properties that make one metal better suited than others for various purposes. The metals do not correspond neatly to particular Arcana or Practices, though: selecting the optimum metals for an item is a matter of intuition rather than charts and formulas. For instance, dull, heavy lead is often associated with Death, but lead’s ancient use as a vehicle for curses gives perfected lead an affinity for Fate as well — never mind that mages also associate Fate with lunargent, the metal of the Acanthus Watchtower. The strength of siderite, however, makes it the best perfected metal for weapons, no matter what spells the weapon bears. </div><div>Forge Masters also alloy the perfected metals. Some of these do  have intrinsic magical powers of their own; thaumium is the best-known example. The Atlanteans knew dozens of perfected alloys. Modern mages know only a few. The Forge Masters study Atlantean artifacts in hopes of reconstructing the “trade secrets” of forgotten alloys. Each alloy requires its own spell of Matter and Prime to forge, however — analogous to “Forge Thaumium” (see Mage: The Awakening , p. 203).</div> <h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2> <div>As a Legacy, the Forge Masters set no formal requirements a recruit must meet, beyond the necessary competence at metalwork and the Arcana of Matter and Prime. Each master decides on his own whether to accept an apprentice, and helps shape his student’s soul when the master thinks the student is ready. No Forge Master has the authority to question another Forge Master’s judgment in this respect. </div><div>In practice, Powersmiths usually demand at least a year of apprenticeship before inducting a mage into the Legacy. Helping an apprentice to craft his soul is quite a drastic expenditure on a Forge Master’s part, comparable to forging an imbued item. They do not expend their own soul’s force lightly. A year of hard work pays the tutor in advance, and makes sure the prospective Powersmith really, truly wants to devote his life to  the Legacy. It also gives the tutor and pupil a chance to discover any personality conflicts before what may be a lifetime’s work together. </div><div>Initiating a new Forge Master is the Legacy’s most elaborate ritual. The tutor builds a special furnace of stone and clay, using no magic whatsoever and no tools he did not forge himself. A hollow in the furnace floor holds a cup of the tutor’s own blood and as much tass as he can collect. </div><div>The apprentice climbs into the furnace. He carries a nail of siderite. The tutor fires the furnace with Mana, using the spells “Celestial Flame” and “Channel Mana” (see Mage: The Awakening , p. 224), and seals the apprentice inside. The spell-fire is modulated to cause pain but not serious damage. The apprentice drives the siderite nail through one wrist and lets his blood fall into the spell-fire to mingle with his tutor’s blood. Then he meditates as his tutor channels the spell-fire into his body and soul, until the pupil absorbs all the Mana he can, charged with the resonance of blood, iron and fire. </div><div>The tutor breaks open the furnace. The pupil steps forth, glowing with spell-fire, and the Forge Master strikes the pupil with a phantasmal hammer of Mana imbued with the pupil’s own soul-pattern. The Powersmith literally hammers his apprentice’s soul into a new form. At the end, the pupil leaps into a waiting bath of cold water and lets the Mana flood out of him in a rush. Thus does he temper his own soul and lock it into the Legacy’s pattern. When he emerges, the siderite nail is gone — consumed along with the tass. The tutor destroys the furnace and may even disintegrate its stones, so it shall never be used for any purpose less sacred. </div><div>The second Attainment involves a similar rite. This time, however, the pupil stabs his other wrist with a nail of thaumium. The third Attainment involves a third sojourn in the furnace, but the Forge Master stabs his own side with a blade of electrum magicum , the alloy of all seven perfected metals. </div><div>The initiation of a new Forge Master is a big event in the Legacy. Since an initiation is usually scheduled months in advance, other Powersmiths have plenty of time to learn about the ceremony. Even if the tutor doesn’t belong to a guild, several other Forge Masters probably attend to watch and toast the new Powersmith.</div> <h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Enchantments of the Forge</h3> <div>Forge Masters know as wide a range of magic as any other mage, but crafting magic items is their reason for existence. They have few rivals in this demanding art. Over the millennia, Forge Masters gave the orders several rotes to imbue magic items or to assist in the enchantment process. These rotes are now considered Free Council rotes, though the Atlantean orders may know them, too. </div><div>Creating a magic item is a big event among Forge Masters. They don’t do it as often as they’d like because of the high personal cost (represented by the sacrifice of a dot of Willpower). Once upon a time, they believe, Powersmiths could imbue their works with magic purely through their craft and their Attainments. Now, however, a mage must place part of his Awakened soul in an item to preserve its magic. One consequence is that Forge Masters seldom waste their craft on small enchantments: they forge the most powerful and wonderful item they can. They also charge correspondingly high prices for their work, in rotes, favors and perfected metals as well as cash. </div><div>The forging of a wonder is a sufficiently rare and valued feat that any Powersmith who hears about it probably shows up to watch, kibitz and try to pick up a magical trade secret or two. Apart from Attainments, crafting magic items is the key to prestige in the Legacy. For all the rough humor among Forge Masters, they feel great respect for colleagues who have imbued metal with powerful and innovative enchantments.</div>",
        "attainmentsDescrizione": "<div>The Attainments of the Forge Masters strengthen the metaphysical imbuement of purpose that distinguishes a tool from unshaped matter. At first, a Powersmith can work only a slight augmentation to make a tool or weapon subtly better at fulfilling its purpose, whatever that may be. Later, the Forge Master can strengthen this subtle power enough that an item can affect incorporeal entities. The greatest Powersmiths live up to their nickname by creating magic items from primal energy itself. </div><div>A Forge Master could perform all these feats through force of will, but he would wrench reality by doing so. The subtle magic of this Legacy, however, builds on the basic fact that a skilled artisan can improve whatever he works upon. To use each Attainment, a Forge Master must spend at least a turn testing, maintaining or otherwise fiddling with the item he wants to enchant. The character can obtain longer-lasting  results by a full scene of mundane-seeming work on the item. For example, a Forge Master might sharpen a blade or tune a pickup truck’s engine. </div><div>These Attainments work best on items principally made of metal, since that is the Legacy’s focus. Nevertheless, a Forge Master can use his Attainments on tools and weapons of other materials. Instead of a day, however, the effects last only one scene after the mage finishes his work, and he must expend one Mana (on top of any other cost). In any case, these Attainments cannot affect anything with a Size greater than 15. Any larger target requires actual spellcasting, with all the risks that entails.</div>",

        "firstAttainmentPrerequisites": "Gnosis 3, Prime 2, Matter 2, Craft 3",
        "firstAttainmentDescription": "<div>The knowing hand of a master craftsman can work away slight imperfections in a tool, improving its performance. A knife becomes sharper, a gun better balanced, a car handles better; even a hairpin can become a better lockpick, or a metal flute gains a sweeter tone. Whatever the Forge Master works upon gains the “9 again” quality, as if he had used the Matter 2 “Alter Accuracy” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 196). The mage’s Prime dots determine the maximum number of rolls within the next day for which the item can gain this effect.</div><div>The improvement to function becomes most obvious, perhaps, with weapons. Any task gains a greater chance of success, however, if performed with tools improved by The Master’s Hand. For instance, a car given a magical tuneup performs better in a chase or other challenging conditions (“9 again” on Dexterity + Drive), improvised tools let an amateur pick locks like an experienced burglar (Dexterity + Larceny) and a musician gives a better performance on the cleaned and slightly modified flute (Manipulation + Expression). Obviously, any repair attempt becomes more likely to succeed using augmented tools, so a sensible Powersmith carefully burnishes and tests his tools before important mechanical tasks.</div><div>In addition, a Forge Master automatically sees the enchantments on enhanced items, imbued items and artifacts, as if he used the Prime 1 “Analyze Enchanted Item” spell (see Mage: The Awakening , pp. 219–220), but rolling Intelligence + Occult + Prime. That a made object bears enchantment is as obvious as its color; analyzing the enchantment still requires the dice roll. This mystical sense does not detect magic not associated with objects shaped by intelligence; for example, this sense won’t register an active Hallow. To sense other magical auras, a Forge Master needs to use normal spells or rotes.</div>",

        "secondAttainmentDescription": "<div>As a Powersmith gains in mastery, he can strengthen the power of will and purpose in any man-made object to make it realer than real: it becomes metaphysically potent enough to affect Twilight and Shadow entities such as ghosts and spirits. This acts like the Prime 3 “Ephemeral Enchantment” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 225), except no roll is required. The  mage’s dots in Prime serve as the number of successes. Primal Tempering lasts a scene if performed as an instant action, or a full day if the Forge Master works on the object for a full scene. Only one object receives the subtle enchantment, so if a Forge Master wanted to enchant extra ammunition for a gun, he would need to spend an additional scene or action using Primal Tempering on each magazine. A suit of armor counts as one entity because one person wears the various pieces, but a suit of armor and a shield would nevertheless require separate enchantments.</div><div>A Forge Master with Prime 5 can endow an object with the power to inflict aggravated damage. This still requires a user who can supply the item with Mana, however, or the Powersmith can grant the item its own Mana reserve.</div><div>The metaphysical density given by Primal Tempering extends to more than attack and defense. The object becomes as real and solid to incorporeal entities as it is in the material world. Not only does Primally Tempered armor blocks a spirit’s attacks, but an entity in Twilight could push the keys of a Primally Tempered typewriter to type a message, or the entity might find a Primally Tempered steel box as hard to escape as a mortal would. The Storyteller should judge such cases based on the purpose  of the object: a spirit could type on the typewriter but not pick it up to batter a material foe, because a typewriter exists to write, not to be used as a bludgeon — and that reason for existence is what Primal Tempering strengthens so it extends into spiritual realms.</div><div> This Attainment also grants a small benefit to the “Imbue Item” spell or “Forge of Power” rote (see Mage: The Awakening , pp. 225–226), though the Attainment’s benefit does not substitute for the rote or spell. For a Forge Master with this Attainment, enchanting a magic item always counts as covert magic, even if the spells stored in the item are vulgar. Using  the item can still cause Paradoxes.</div>",

Similar to the basic Primal Tempering, this requires the mage to work on the object in some mundane way.",

        "thirdAttainmentDescription": "At the apex of the Legacy’s power, a Forge Master no longer needs a forge. He has so internalized the power of toolmaking that he can conjure weapons, armor or simple mechanical devices from pure Mana or tass. A Powersmith cannot conjure a device with its own power source (no automobiles or electric drills), and nothing much more complicated than a push-lawnmower or combination lock. The mage’s rating in Prime acts as the relevant factors for whatever the Forge Master creates. An item that lasts only a scene takes a turn to conjure; if the Powersmith spends a full scene, he can create an item that lasts a full day, and, in addition, give the item Primal Tempering  or imbue it with spells. Any spells cast into the conjured item still count toward the mage’s normal number of spells in use. Nevertheless, sometimes it’s extremely useful to conjure a powerful magic sword — even if it only lasts a day.",

        "thirdAttainmentOptDescrizione": "If the Forge Master is also an Adept of Matter, anything conjured by the Primal Forge also gains additional Durability, as with the Matter-based advantage to Primal Tempering. The Attainment can also conjure items of siderite and other perfected metals. This makes conjured items easier to temporarily imbue with spells (thanks to the +1 equipment bonus to spellcasting). A conjured item of siderite does not gain still more Durability for its substance: the object is still, after all, just a very good illusion."

Though the core of the Legacy resembles their namesakes from Scandinavian history, they also represent the Armenian gusan, the Greek aoidos , the Celtic bards and the Islamic Sufi. Through poetry and song, the Skalds remember and represent the Tapestry’s history and meaning. They learn the meter and the tune of the world and its past, and they live to retain and spread story and song. </div><div>Memorization and recitation are important to the tradition of the Skalds. The epic of Gilgamesh and Homer’s tales are the Skalds’ forerunners or, some believe, their legacies. Their tales describe the heroes of ancient legend and the falls of kings. They reward folly with ill fortune and extol the virtues of the day. Culture is one of their messages, poetry and song their conveyance, satire is one of their swords and wit a serviceable shield. </div><div>The Sagas of the Skalds are their heritage. These rhythmic, sometimes melodic performances embody the culture, the land, the times and the persons of all the Skalds who have come before. The Sagas are very long. Each Skald learns the entirety of the Saga that came before from her tutor, then adds her own experience and wisdom to it as she goes on, which she will eventually pass on to her apprentices. There are hundreds of concurrent Sagas of the Skalds in the world, many of them variations on the same theme but all meaningful, potent and valuable to the Legacy. </div><div>More than just remembrance, the magic of their words and melodies can change the world. Through song, they enact the wonders of their Legacy. Skalds can call to them the spirits of the land or of the past, and such entities often heed their beautiful words. While Skalds communicate with and understand spirits, this Legacy reveres the human culture, and Skalds often use their influence over the unseen to help tame or shape a region for other mages, or for humans in general.</div>",

There are always a few mages who think the Legacy’s members are wasting their time on memorization, or that they spend too much effort on the past or that they are just plain fruity, but these detractors are in the minority. The sheer usefulness of  the Skalds’ traditions cannot be denied, and their dedication earns them a great deal of respect. <div>Members of the Mysterium consider Lore-singers great resources. The epics, poetry and songs they memorize have been passed down within the Legacy for ages. Mystagogues see untold potential in the Legacy’s heritage. When the Mysterium can, the order quenches its thirst for ancient legends from the Skalds’ cup and sifts through those words for clues to the Mysteries. The Mysterium is a common order to spawn a Skald, since both groups have a deep appreciation for remembering the past. </div><div>For the Free Council, the respect they hold for the Legacy is based on its philosophy: the Skalds memorize so that they can recite, not hoard. Though the methods of their memorization may be held from the unworthy, Libertines appreciate a group unaffiliated with their Council that believes in sharing the knowledge in their stories and music. Free Council members with enough influence may trade favors to prominent local Skalds in exchange for recitations in the Council’s local Lorehouses. </div><div>The Adamantine Arrow and Silver Ladder both appreciate the Skalds. After all, the members of this Legacy are most likely to glorify and immortalize those orders’ exploits. Arrows become very proud when their actions end up in a modern epic. Silver Ladder mages occasionally become a little more nervous about what the Skalds might say. There is no end of laud for a hero in battle, but the same bards who spread that word are just as adept at recording a mage’s shame. And that happens more often in the realm of politics, where the Silver Ladder loves to play and excel. Still, the Silver Ladder considers the Skalds more positive than negative, because all of them hope  to get “good press.” </div><div>Only the Guardians of the Veil don’t give much thought, good or ill, to the Skalds. After all, spies and assassins don’t get songs.</div>",
        "appearance": " There’s nothing in particular that sets a Skald apart from other mages, but Skalds do have some traits in common. Skalds are good listeners, a quality they gain after long practice at memorizing songs and poetry word-for-word. Most are quite personable. A sizable subset of the Legacy tends toward wandering the Awakened world, so many Skalds are in good physical shape. Finally, a Skald often has a musical instrument of some kind, even something as simple as a recorder or a harmonica, though most favor musical tools that allow them to sing simultaneously.",
        "background": " Mages who choose to become Skalds typically have some prior affinity for the arts. Some come into the Legacy with strong backgrounds in music and poetry; others build on their fond study of history or cultural literature o f all kinds. More than a few combine all these. Teaching is a common profession and passion among the Skalds. Poetry and music aren’t the only arts they favor. Many also paint, sculpt or just about anything creative — though they skew away from the more postmodern interpretations of “art.”",
        "organizzation": "<div>Skalds are only loosely tied to one another. One has very little influence over another, even with greater mastery over the Legacy’s Attainments. It is in their nature to be respectful of their elders, who can teach them, but respect is not obeisance. Each Skald is busy soaking up the zeitgeist of his time, composing the sonnets and epics that acclaim or curse rulers or heroes of the day. The Skald remembers, recites and records. There’s no reason for an elder Skald to give his students orders, because they do not perform missions or have concrete tasks. Their only mission is to watch, to absorb the ambiance and from it to create. </div><div>Perhaps because Skalds do not feel obligated to one another, they communicate freely and often. Tutors and their apprentices know each other best and talk the most, but they are not secretive with contacts among the Legacy. If anything, Skalds are more open with each other than most mages. It isn’t hard for one Skald to meet another in a far-away Consilium, even through a connection as vague as a twice-removed “cousin” in the Legacy. Communicating allows the Skalds to share poems and songs that they discover and create, and they do so eagerly. </div><div>There is usually only one Skald in a given Consilium, as the Skalds reason that it is better not to serve a region with too much recitation and song. More of them occasionally come together for training or for competition. When a mage is just joining the Legacy, he goes where his tutor goes. The apprentice studies under her, learning the Legacy’s memorization tricks and ancient poetic tradition. After the student has learned enough about being a Skald to do the duty and not embarrass his tutor, she cuts him loose. He may stay around or he may find his own place, but he’s not going to have someone watching out for him anymore — even when the student and tutor remain on good terms. </div><div>Skalds sometimes come together for friendly (or unfriendly) competitions. Such events are much more occasions for several Skalds to share their compositions and spread their communal knowledge than real competitions. Depending on who attends, these can resemble poetry readings (or, less often, slams), historical debates, art exhibitions, mini-Woodstocks or combinations of them all. Even in friendly company, Skalds are generally proud of their skill at melody or oratory, and they really do try to out-perform one another. It’s a matter of honor and renown. </div><div>Rivalries do exist between Skalds, and one might challenge another out of ambition instead of friendly competition. There’s usually little more than recognition riding on the result, but two Skalds might agree that the victor in such a contest wins the right to serve a particular region or Consilium as the “official” or “foremost” Skald and chronicler. There’s no stigma attached to challenges, at least not among members of the Legacy. They understand that the region wouldn’t be under contention unless it were interesting and influential, and an area worth fighting over should have the best Lore-singer available. </div><div>Not all Skalds settle down in one area or Consilium. Some feel they best serve their calling by traveling, seeing the places that aren’t frequented by others and being the flies on the wall in those places. Traveling Lore-singers pass through Consilii with “resident” Skalds every few weeks or months, depending on their habits. When one does, it is common practice to introduce herself to the member of her Legacy first. He then introduces the traveler to the Consilium, lessening the suspicion common about unknown mages. The foreign Skald has the opportunity to play for the Consilium, the local Loresinger gets to hear where the traveler’s been and play for her in turn and the Consilium gets a show. The local Skald’s only responsibility is to vouch for the traveler, not to house her; she must earn her keep on her own, generally by bringing news and song to the Consilium.</div>",

But they also charge themselves with improving a society, a kingdom or Consilium, by reminding those who live  in it of what is right. The Skalds’ airs and epics move and inspire, and it is with this gentle lever that the Legacy tries to move the world.</div><div>Though most Skalds are perceptive, as skilled at untangling the webs of influence in a Consilium as they are at recognizing individuals’ moods and desires, natural skill is not always enough. A Skald with the first Attainment has the ability to read the tenor of an audience. This effect is similar to the Mind 1 “Aura Perception” spell, except that Soothe the Beast reveals the general emotional condition of a crowd, rather than individual auras, although intense individual emotions might still be noticeable.</div><div>By playing a song or reciting a poem or story for at least a minute, the Skald can project a certain emotion into the minds of those who hear it. It might be sadness, or anger at an injustice, or, if she directs her songs toward a single individual (such as a Hierarch), searing shame. The more people she tries to project to, the less intense the emotion.

The Hierarch may know the feelings to be false, or she may discard the emotion as a mere twinge of the conscience. When a person cannot be made to repent, it is the Skald’s duty to force that person to admit fault and accept punishment, or leave for the better of the Consilium. </div><div>Using this Attainment requires the Skald to perform a critical song or poem, or to plan and put on a satirical mummery or a play. In some way, he must communicate to the intended target and to those around her the failings and flaws they should see. At the Attainment’s shortest, this is an instant action based around a short couplet. Used with longer forms of art, the action takes place several times throughout the performance. As an example, consider Hamlet’s uncle as the target of this effect. </div><div>The Skald’s player rolls Manipulation + Expression — victim’s Composure. Each success subtracts one point of Willpower from the target as the satire affects her, making her acutely aware of her failings, their effects and the right thing to do. If this effect reduces the target’s Willpower to zero, she cannot contain or deny her shame any longer. She must either flee the scrutiny of her peers (nearly always diminishing her in their eyes) or admit her faults and submit herself to their judgments. </div><div>A Skald can use this Attainment on a single target once per dot of his own Intelligence per scene. If the scene ends without  bringing the target to zero, the target regains any Willpower lost to this effect. Clever Skalds may be able to fool a target into expecting another such cutting remark, even when the Skald cannot use the power again, and confess to lesser crimes to stave off the final blow.</div>",
        "secondAttainmentOptArcana": "Spirit 3",
        "secondAttainmentOptDescrizione": "<div>By whistling a melody, singing an aria or (most commonly) reciting verse composed for the purpose, the Skald impresses a nearby spirit and sways it to assist her. While the Lore-singer need not necessarily be able to see the spirit, the spirit must be able to hear her as she acts. She must also craft the performance to a specific entity; the performance cannot affect “the nearest spirit” or “a tree spirit” unless she knows specifically which spirit that is — usually by first observing it. </div><div>This Attainment resembles the Spirit 3 “Control Spirit” spell. By performing for at least one minute per Rank of the target spirit, the Skald may command that spirit with a Presence + Expression + Spirit roll, contested by the spirit’s Resistance. One potent benefit of this Attainment is that the spirit generally does not feel put-upon. The skill and meaning of the Skald’s performance makes the spirit want  to perform the set tasks. When the effect’s duration ends, the spirit returns to its old habits, but it does not feel anger at being compelled. The spirit was moved by the poetry, not by the mage’s will. </div><div>This does not necessarily appear as magic to those who watch the Skald use it. To onlookers, the performance appears to be particularly poignant and meaningful. Some connect it to the subsequent movement of the earth or strike of lightning. Only those with some understanding of Spirit recognize the spiritual influence that leads the words or music, and often only another Skald can decipher exactly what commands the performance contains. </div><div>Lore-singers generally use this Attainment not to use spirits as spies or servants, but to utilize the spirits’ particular Influences. One tune calms the storm-spirit and thus calms the storm; a well-worded sonnet causes an earthquake that slows a region’s invaders. Skald use spirit’s Influences to make forests more verdant, fields more bountiful or political infighters more susceptible to reason. The Skalds’ influence over and relationships with the spirits of a region are the mainstay of their power.</div>",

When that is the case, the Skalds must drive people to cure themselves, to do what they are otherwise unwilling to do and begin the process of recovery.  </div><div>This Attainment requires an instant action to perform, and its power carries through an appropriate recitation or song. Woven through the art is a deeply concealed, strong mental suggestion. The power is like the Mind 4 “Telepathic Control” spell and requires a roll of Manipulation + Expression + Mind, reflexively opposed by the target’s Composure + Gnosis. With  Mind 5, this Attainment can have prolonged Duration, just as the spell, and the Skald may affect additional targets for the typical dice penalties. Commanding people in this way is not obvious. Observers perceive the singing or the poetry, and then the target of the Attainment acts. Even Mage Sight does not reveal the influence of Hearing the Kind Piper.  </div><div>That the Skalds wield secret, effective mind control frightens many. For this reason, the Skalds apply a very public code of ethics to the use of this Attainment. Wherever mages know of the Legacy and its Attainments, they also know that the Skalds are dedicated to using this influence only  in pursuit of bettering individuals and societies. The Skalds use this control to expose the corrupt and reveal bashful heroes. On the individual level, the Skalds might help a person quit an addiction or not murder in a fit of passion, but even these are skirting the edge. The code, handed down from ancient times, directs Skalds to most often use this power in the healing of a Consilium — or in revenge against any who has lifted a hand against a fellow Skald.  </div><div>A Skald who uses the third Attainment improperly risks censure by his fellow Skalds, and news of such disgraceful behavior is the sort that never fails to be carried by traveling Skalds. In part, the Consilii accept this code of behavior because Skalds so rarely show signs of severe Paradoxes; unwise mages would surely show more sign. Of course, just because the rule is in place doesn’t mean no Skald ever breaks the rule.</div>",

This technique makes the agreement between the two easier to make explicit. The Skald gives a spirit the ability to possess a creature of the Fallen World, similar to the Spirit 4 “Spirit Possession” spell but with no roll required. This makes it possible for a spirit of the land to address a Consilium directly. In Consilii where everyone is able to see and speak with spirits under their own power, this may not be necessary, but such Consilii are the exception rather than the rule. In such situations, a mage or Sleepwalker volunteers to host the spirit.</div><div>Occasionally, this skill can also be a bargaining chip for spirits who do not normally have the Possession Numen and want the opportunity to use it.</div>"

Such a view is arrogant in the extreme, say the Sphinxes, for to look at the Sleepers as inferior is to ignore one’s own humanity. No, to the mages who choose to follow this Legacy, the true magic of humanity is language. More to the point, it is the capacity for symbolic recognition, to see a gesture or a marking, hear a collection of sounds, and from that understand. Human beings are optimized, either by the design of a greater being or the rigors of evolution, toward speech and language, both anatomically and neurologically. But all of the biophysical adaptations of the human body toward speech mean nothing without the ability to understand symbols. Upon this phenomenon (some would say “miracle”), the Legacy of the Sphinx is based.</div><div>Walking the path of the Sphinx is an exercise in abstraction, for the Legacy teaches understanding without processing, learning truth without realizing fact. A Sphinx sees meaning everywhere — in the number of cracks in a sidewalk, in the seemingly random sounds from a baby’s babbling, in the texture of a brick wall. Intrinsic in this ability to find meaning anywhere is the knowledge that this meaning comes from somewhere. Sphinxes who cleave to the Atlantean model of mystical understanding posit that this meaning might come from ancient masters sending information forward in time, in a much more subtle way than with the ananke (see p. 330 of Mage: The Awakening). Those who do not follow the orders of the Pentacle — and even some who do — believe that this truth comes directly from the Supernal Realms.</div><div>The name “Sphinx,” of course, comes from the mythological creature that Oedipus confronted near Thebes. He solved the riddle of the Sphinx, and she leaped to her death in horror that her secret was revealed. Whether the name “Sphinx” was one that members of this Legacy originally applied to themselves or not, they do not see themselves as jealous keepers of secrets. Indeed, they tend to view themselves as searchers trying to solve a riddle. That riddle is difficult to express, because it is so vast in scope, but the basic idea is this: If meaning can be found in anything, at any level of understanding or consciousness, then what is the ultimate meaning? Where does the truth come from, and to what purpose?</div>",

The order’s predilection for finding, analyzing and cataloguing knowledge, combined with the fact that the Mysterium often encounters information too dangerous to be read and understood by an untrained mage, points members of all Paths toward the Legacy. Outside of the Mysterium, the order that claims the largest number of Pathfinders is unquestionably the Guardians of the Veil. Sphinxes are by nature superlative ciphers, capable of breaking almost any code or circumventing any puzzle, given enough time. The Guardians thus appreciate their ability to weave symbols and hidden messages, both true and misleading, into the secret societies and fronts that the order sets up. In fact, it isn’t uncommon for an Epopt to be a Sphinx herself or at least work with one. It’s easy for even the Guardians themselves to become lost in the morass of conflicting symbolism and double-blind codes, and a Sphinx makes a good “skeleton key” when quick understanding and interpretation are necessary.<div>Warlocks of other orders do find their way to the Legacy as well, of course. Sphinxes of the Adamantine Arrow tend to use their ability to find meaning and truth in the mundane as a way to avoid danger and protect those around them. Pathfinders in the Free Council stay on the cutting edge of linguistic theory and language development, searching for ways to expand people’s understanding of each other and themselves. The Silver Ladder’s few Sphinxes often believe that the Ladder is the best way to recreate some of the conditions in lost Atlantis, and thus come closer to the secrets and messages that the ancients held.</div>",

Pathfinders also tend to be good listeners and remain open to communication with others. Thus, Pathfinders go out of their way to appear non-threatening and available.",

Outside the order, Pathfinders have little in the way of formal contact, though when they encounter each other the meeting is usually friendly.<div>The relationship between mentor and student varies. Since the training requires so much intuition and comparatively little actual study, some students come to resent their mentors, feeling that they are deliberately keeping secrets and knowledge from the students.

The Mastigos of the time knew that with the application of the Mind Arcanum they could comprehend any earthly language, but that wasn’t enough. Language wasn’t the true barrier, these mages discovered, because a language is merely a set of symbols. These primordial Sphinxes realized that inherent in the process of making symbols lay the solution to the confusion caused by the destruction of the Celestial Ladder — that they could look beyond graphemes and sounds and simply communicate with pure meaning.</div><div>Modern-day Sphinxes sometimes claim that the Legacy was an important part of the formation of the Mysterium, and that might well be true. Whether or not this was the case, the Sphinx Legacy became, over time, the province of the Wings of the Dragon almost exclusively. While a lone Mastigos might occasionally discover and follow the Legacy, the order guarded its secrets jealously. Something as basic to humanity as the quest for communication and language, however, wasn’t going to remain under lock and key forever.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The De Velasco Resurgence</h3><div>The first reliably recorded instance of a mage outside the Mysterium joining the Legacy came in 1575 or so, in a book written by a Spanish nobleman (and Mastigos) named Juan de Velasco. De Velasco had observed his two young cousins, who were both born deaf, being tutored by a Benedictine monk named Pedro Ponce de Léon. Classical opinions on the deaf stated that they had very little education potential and that they could never learn to speak (if deafness occurred pre-lingually). Ponce de Léon, himself a Sleeper, challenged that opinion, and taught the de Velasco brothers not only to read and write, but to speak three different languages. He did not, however, record his methods, and so history would have to wait for widespread methods of educating the deaf, but Juan de Velasco watched his cousins’ lessons with interest. He was less interested in teaching deaf people than in the conveyance of meaning in non-verbal ways. He wrote several treatises on the topic for his Consilium, the most famous of which was titled “The Art and Science of the Recognition of Meaning.” In that document, he detailed how he was able to send coded messages through paintings and divine the immediate future by listening to hymns at Mass (as later mages have pointed out, de Velasco probably wasn’t reading the future per se; rather, he was reading probability).</div><div>De Velasco’s writings have been translated into many different languages over the years, although modern Sphinxes have found that reading them in their original Latin yields layers of meaning far beyond the simple message of the words. The Mysterium currently holds most of these documents, but de Velasco was a prolific writer and painter, and historians the world over might unknowingly hold either one of his esoteric writings or hauntingly beautiful paintings. Either type of work might actually be a road map to a rote, an Atlantean temple or some other worthy goal. </div><div>De Velasco left no record behind of a pupil, but it is widely accepted that de Velasco passed his learning along to another Mastigos. Whether this pupil was a member of the Mysterium or not is a debated issue; the order claims that he was, while members of all of the other orders also claim him (and often have records that seem to support their claims). The Mysterium has history on its side, of course, but after de Velasco the Legacy became available to any mage of the order who wished to become a Pathfinder. Since then, the Mysterium has tried to project the image that they created the Legacy in the first place. Even so, the Legacy remains the province of the Warlocks just as much as that of the Alae Draconis.</div><div>Other than de Velasco, history has not produced famous Sphinxes. The Pathfinders tend to be inscrutable and unobtrusive, even by Awakened standards, and, of course, any mage who achieved mastery of the Legacy’s Attainments would be exceptionally difficult to find in any record (see the Off the Path Attainment, below). The Mysterium, true to form, tries to keep records of the members of the order who have gone on to become Pathfinders, but the Sphinxes themselves often alter such records, leaving behind only obtuse riddles that, properly interpreted, might lead to the mage in question.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2></div><div>Because so much of the Sphinx mindset and activity relies on observation rather than direct action, mages outside of the Mysterium don’t often know much about the Legacy. What they do know tends to depend on who they hear it from or the particular Sphinx they’ve encountered. Some Sphinxes are infuriatingly cryptic, either because they genuinely enjoy lording their uncanny insight over others or because they are inundated with so much information that they fear to reveal too much or too little. Other Sphinxes are happy to share what they know, but are well aware that their information tends to be true, but lacking in context. Consider: A Sphinx can read a thick book in an ancient language in an hour and understand all of the information it contains, but he will be hard-pressed to convey the nuances and intricacies of the information. His rendition of the information resembles a quick summary, and this leaves listeners to wonder about its accuracy. Indeed, it’s not uncommon for non-Sphinxes to assume that a Pathfinder is using some kind of fortune-telling method to glean the information, and such methods (often based on Time or Space magic) aren’t often completely accurate. The Sphinxes protest this, saying that their methods rely on direct observation rather than symbolic guesswork, but because those methods are based largely on intuition that non-Sphinxes do not possess these protests often go unheard. In the end, many Pathfinders find it easiest not to advertise their membership in the Legacy and to offer help and advice only when it is requested. Of course, that sometimes results in other mages labeling them reclusive and unhelpful, but an experienced Pathfinder has long since given up on pleasing all the people all the time.</div><div>The culture of the Sphinx Legacy is one of research, academia and intuition. Sphinxes aren’t necessarily impulsive, but they do tend to be easily distracted, and mentors of the Legacy encourage Pathfinders to follow clues that they see in the hidden patterns of the world. This leads Sphinxes to cross paths with cabals of mages and even stranger inhabitants of the World of Darkness, and so members of the Legacy tend to be skilled at either diplomacy or flight (or, more rarely, defensive combat). Among the Awakened, Sphinxes try to become well-versed in which cabal holds influence in what area and who the local movers and shakers of the Consilium are, just in case the Sphinxes need to name-drop to justify trespassing. Their skill in dealing with people grants them a great deal of latitude in such situations, and so Sphinxes often occupy positions in a Consilium such as Herald or Councilor.</div><div>In the Mysterium, the Sphinx takes up the role of guardian, much like his namesake. Sphinxes don’t ask riddles of seekers, but they also don’t give information out to just anyone. This isn’t due to a perception that others aren’t worthy of the knowledge (usually), but rather that the knowledge in question might be dangerous. Sphinxes can absorb information without attracting its attention, learning by observation of patterns rather than direct reading and study. As such, a Sphinx might administer a coded test to a mage seeking a book or fact that the Sphinx considers risky. If the mage has the patience and skill to decipher it, the Sphinx considers it safe to grant the mage what he seeks. This role, of course, is the very definition of a thankless task, since it brands the Sphinx as a stingy distributor of knowledge. Even so, it is a role for which the Pathfinders are uniquely suited, and so members of the Legacy who belong to the Mysterium often become Censors.</div><div>The Legacy’s overarching philosophy — that the universe has meaning and that this meaning was put in place deliberately — doesn’t actually see much discussion among Sphinxes unless one of them has made a breakthrough. New members of the Legacy often hear the theory on the matter that their tutors espouse, and pick up more as they interact with other Pathfinders. Most Sphinxes have preconceived notions about the nature of the meaning of the universe. Popular hypotheses include the following:</div><ul><li><strong>God:</strong> Regardless of what religion or faith the Sphinx espouses, the notion of a Divine creator (or at least organizer) is almost as popular among mages as among Sleepers. The fact that no explanation of Atlantis, the Fall, the Celestial Ladder, or the Supernal Realms actually contradicts this belief is helpful. Theist Sphinxes believe that the messages they see in everyday patterns are God’s communication with Earth, and that the language of pure meaning is the true divine language.</li><li><strong>Oracles:</strong> Sphinxes with a more magic-centered view of the world believe that the Oracles, the secret masters trapped in the Supernal Realms during the collapse of the Celestial Ladder, manipulate events and patterns so subtly that these machinations are virtually unnoticeable unless one is specifically looking. These Sphinxes claim that, with rare exceptions (such as the ananke), the Oracles cannot communicate directly, as the Abyss thwarts them. Only by nudging the world in imperceptible ways — causing a flock of birds to take flight at the right second, a gust of wind that alters the direction of raindrops, and so on — can they send their messages. Of course, if the Oracles can do this, the Sphinxes sometimes wonder, what stops the Exarchs from doing so as well? The answer is: nothing, and the Seers of the Throne boast their share of Pathfinders.</li><li><strong>The Supernal Realms:</strong> Although the Sphinx Legacy belongs as much to the Warlocks as to the Mysterium, comparatively few Mastigos espouse this particular theory to explain the origin of the messages in the world. Those who do are quite different from the usual contemplative and observant Pathfinders — such Mastigos tend to be fearful and paranoid. Some Sphinxes believe that the denizens of the Supernal Realms are responsible for the informative patterns that the Sphinxes so diligently analyze. These denizens might not even be creating these patterns deliberately, the mages say, but the Fallen World reflects the Supernal Realms. Therefore, the true nature of reality comes through in everything the world has to offer, regardless of whether Sleepers (or even most of the Awakened) are prepared to look for it. Of course, the implications of the inhabitants of Pandemonium leaving hints for mages to find are troubling, to say the least. This, perhaps, is why this theory has more adherents among Mysterium Sphinxes of other Paths. The notion that the patterns are the inhuman whispers of demons is profoundly disquieting. No matter which Supernal Realm the patterns originate from, though (and it would make more sense to assume that all of them have some input), their natives are inscrutable and largely unknowable by human standards, yet certainly not all-powerful. Is there a greater design above even the mysterious clues left in random patterns of wind, ink, and brick?</li></ul><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Prospective Sphinxes often begin their training for the Legacy before they know it exists. Inquisitive and persistent, they pay close attention to the world around them, searching for an overlying meaning. Chaos theory, fractal theory and even the “theory” of intelligent design have produced students of the right mindset to become Pathfinders. If a mage looks deeply enough into the right patterns, using the right methods, he might receive a flash of insight that allows him to break a message coded with the Hidden Meaning Attainment. Alternately, his studies might just lead him to a mage already known for the same kind of research. In any case, sooner or later the prospective Sphinx finds a Sphinx.</div><div>Presuming that the Sphinx that the prospective member finds is willing and able to take on a pupil, and that the chemistry between the two mages is of the right sort to permit such a relationship, the tutor typically inundates the student with coded messages. At first, the mage simply uses mundane codes, starting with simple alphabetical ciphers and moving up to complex encryption. The mage doesn’t need to learn how to break all of these codes, and certainly isn’t forbidden from using magic in his attempt. The important lesson here is to look beyond letters, numbers and words and see meaning in markings, sounds and patterns. This kind of approach isn’t easy to teach, as it relies more on intuition than process, and some mages simply aren’t up to the task. The tutor watches carefully to see if his student is capable of learning what the tutor is presenting, of seeing a meaning greater than the message. If so, they can begin the process of soulcrafting. If not, the tutor gently (or not-so-gently, depending on the mage in question) suggests that the student might find what he seeks elsewhere. In the Mysterium, the process works a little differently. Mages who show a predilection for puzzles, ciphers and language are often told about the Legacy in a roundabout fashion (so as to avoid making it seem as though membership in a Legacy is being offered or suggested).</div><div>A mage who is a good candidate for becoming a Pathfinder will pursue information about the Legacy, or so goes the theory. Once word gets out in a given Consilium’s Mysterium cabal(s) that a mage wants to join the Legacy, the network becomes activated and the mage’s accomplishments, history, faults and foibles are made known to any Sphinx who bothers to check. If the mage is a good fit for the Legacy, a tutor arranges to travel to the student or have the student brought to him for training. In either case, the stages of soulcrafting don’t require much in the way of ceremony. Once a mage has reached the required level of power, his tutor assists him in delving deeper into the mysteries of the world’s wisdom. This is normally accompanied by several days of study, questioning and observation of whatever phenomena the mentor feels hold the wisdom the student needs in order to progress. Some tutors hole their students up in libraries preceding a new Attainment, others immerse their charges in as much sensation as possible in order to force the student to focus on one pattern at a time.</div><div>Tutors, whatever their methods, watch their students for signs of madness at all times. When everything around a mage is significant, when nothing is coincidence or meaningless, he can feel paralyzed and helpless, afraid to do anything for fear of offsetting some cosmic balance. Alternately, some Sphinxes become drunk with the power and knowledge they possess, striving to learn as much as they can to exert maximum possible influence in the world. Either of these eventualities is cause for alarm to the tutor, because they distract the student from his quest to learn the origin of meaning. A Sphinx who degenerates too much or too quickly in Wisdom might find himself placed in an oubliette, magically deprived of any sensation whatsoever. It is believed that, in this kind of environment with no patterns from which to derive information, that a mad Sphinx can find himself again and regain his sanity. This doesn’t always work, of course; sometimes the madness just intensifies, but the oubliette is the best the Legacy can do to help. The alternative is to remove the mage’s ability to see the world’s meaning permanently, and the only way to do that is to kill him.</div>",

To the Pathfinders, the important and most difficult part of problem-solving is gaining the knowledge required to solve it. Alexander’s brutish solution to the Gordian Knot repulses them, because it sends the message that brute force can replace patience and understanding. Destructive magic can be countered, manipulative magic can be redirected, but magic that hides knowledge cannot stop a persistent and intelligent willworker.",

        "firstAttainmentDescription": "<div>The Sphinx’s first Attainment allows her to find and decipher wisdom in the mundane. Anything that has a pattern can be used for this purpose, be it cracks in the ceiling or the calls of a flock of birds. The mage merely needs to study the pattern for a few seconds to gain the information contained therein. The effect is similar to the Fate 1 “Interconnections” spell (see p. 148 of Mage: The Awakening), except that the Attainment requires only an instant action and bestows information as though the mage had achieved five successes on the roll. Sphinxes, therefore, are awash in information if they stop to consider it, able to see connections, however faint, between any objects, people or places in sight. In addition to see these sympathetic connections, a Sphinx can use this Attainment to solve puzzles and riddles, since she can see the patterns behind their creation. Sphinx characters with this Attainment receive a +3 modifier to all Mental rolls involving riddles, puzzles, mazes or other such conundrums.</div><div>A more common use of this Attainment, however, is its ability to hide meaning within seemingly random patterns. A Sphinx can use Hidden Meaning to write (or draw or record) a message in a code that no Sleeper cipher can crack. The mage must physically create the message, either by writing a seemingly innocuous letter, drawing a picture or any other method she prefers. The player rolls Manipulation + Investigation or Academics to encrypt the message. When another mage with this Attainment tries to decipher the code, her player must make an extended Intelligence + Investigation roll to do so, with a number of required successes equal to [5 x the successes on the encryption roll]. Again, each roll requires an hour of deciphering. The encoding mage may choose to forego her roll, meaning that any Sphinx can decode the message automatically.</div><div>A mage with Fate 2 can also attempt to uncover the meaning in the message. First she must be aware that the underlying meaning exists, which is by itself difficult (she might be tipped off by an ally, a hunch or even the Dream Merit). She then casts an improvised and extended Fate 2 spell, with a number of required successes equal to [5 x encoder’s successes, minimum of five].</div>",

        "firstAttainmentOptDescrizione": "<div>A Sphinx who has studied the Arcanum of Mind can use her knowledge of the patterns and intrinsic meaning to aid her in interactions with others. By studying a person’s movements, the subtle messages conveyed by facial expression, body language and breathing and even how others react to him, the Sphinx gains an advantage in dealing with him. This effect is similar to the Mind 2 “First Impressions” spell (see p. 208 of Mage: The Awakening). The Sphinx may add her dots in Mind as a dice bonus to the first roll made with a given target.</div><div>Many Pathfinders discover that the first Attainment of the Legacy is all that they require. Indeed, much of the Legacy’s reputation is based upon the knowledge and insight conveyed in Hidden Meaning — the ability to solve puzzles and escape labyrinths, to see meaning in the mundane. Sphinxes who continue on use this Attainment as a basis upon which later, more powerful magic rests. Those who pursue other agendas, however, use Hidden Meaning to send messages to double agents in other factions (or even orders), to share research with colleagues around the world, right under the noses of their enemies, and to help Sleepers and even other mages solve puzzles that no methods the Fallen World has produced can fathom. Sphinxes who make frequent use of this Attainment to encrypt messages often develop a preferred format for those messages. One Sphinx might design websites dedicated to some inane fandom, while another writes poetry reproduced only in small-circulation periodicals. As long as the message reaches its intended viewer, the Sphinx doesn’t often care how the vehicle for the message is regarded.</div><div>Sometimes, though, a Sphinx creates a vehicle for a message that has resonance and value in its own right. When this happens, the message might gain fame and widespread circulation, inadvertently passing the message along to any mage who knows how to look for it. Some such messages are even rumored to trigger Awakenings, as Sleepers on the verge of enlightenment see the Supernal Realms lurking in an otherwise mundane painting or song.</div>",

        "secondAttainmentDescription": "<div>Knowing the truth of the world by interpreting its many hidden messages is only the first step toward the superlative understanding that the Sphinx hopes one day to reach. Along that way, however, she learns to take advantage of the clues that surround her as to the fundamental nature of reality. To the untrained eye, she looks lucky or simply confident, but to a mage, every action she takes is fraught with significance. The second Attainment that a Sphinx can achieve allows her to mimic the effects of the Fate 2 “Exceptional Luck” spell (see p. 151 of Mage: The Awakening). No roll or Mana expenditure is required. The mage simply takes an instant action to study the patterns of meaning around her, in the same way as described for the Hidden Meaning Attainment. The player may then designate a number of rolls equal to the character’s Gnosis rating during the same scene to have the 9 again quality.</div><div>Pathfinders also find that the more they rely on this Attainment, the more resonant their actions become. Mage Sight cast through the Fate Arcanum can easily detect them. Mages attempting to use Fate spells such as “Interconnections” or “The Sybil’s Sight” receive a +1 dice bonus during any scene in which Sphinx has used this Attainment to gain the 9 again quality. This bonus can cancel penalties levied by the Occultation Merit and spells such as Fate 3 “Fabricate Fortune.”</div>",

Also, she can perform research and learning-related extended Mental tasks in half the time they would normally take (that is, if every roll in an extended task would normally take an hour, this time is reduced to 30 minutes).</div><div>The second Attainment of the Sphinx Legacy opens the mage further to the truth of the world and the hidden messages it contains, but still does not address the question of who or what might be sending these messages. Pathfinders at this stage make superb interpreters, translators and researchers (which is one reason the Mysterium teaches this Legacy). More martial Sphinxes enjoy the tactical benefits of this Attainment, but are careful when using it in conflict with other Awakened, as the Sphinxes are wary of coming to the notice of powerful mages by weaving themselves too tightly into the universe’s inner workings. Indeed, the Sphinxes tell stories of members of the Legacy who have become unable to see the world as anything other than an abstract mess of implication and possibility — unable to perceive light or sound anymore, they function solely through the information this Attainment grants.</div>",

As far as the world and its many layers of hidden messages are concerned, the Sphinx no longer exists (for as long as this Attainment is active). The Sphinx spends a moment in silent meditation, perceiving the threads of fate and stepping between them (this requires three turns of contemplation). After this, the mage’s destiny can remain “invisible” in this manner for as long as she wishes, but during this time she cannot use the Truth Without Knowledge Attainment to gain the 9 again quality, or cast any spell altering another person’s destiny (this include spells dealing with oaths, such as “Alter Oath,” as well as spells such as “Occlude Destiny” or “Destroy Bindings”). While the Attainment is active, however, she is immune to all spells that would perceive, alter, improve or denigrate her fate (including the spells just mentioned). All sympathetic magic targeted against her is considered to be four steps further removed.(So, to even attempt targeting her with a sympathetic spell, the caster would need an Intimate connection, which would then suffer a –10 penalty as though it were Described.) Also, the Sphinx is extremely difficult to scrutinize magically. She is considered to have the Occultation Merit at a rating equal to her dots in the Fate Arcanum.</div><div>This Attainment does not make the character physically invisible, but does make her easy to ignore.

At this advanced stage, however, a tic of the eye or a shift of the hand betrays everything about the target — his hopes, his fears and even his memories. This effect is much like the Mind 4 “Read the Depths” spell (see p. 215 of Mage: The Awakening). The mage must spend at least one turn studying the target before using this Attainment. After that, the player rolls Intelligence + Academics – the subject’s Composure. Unlike Read the Depths, mages with the Mind Arcanum do not get a chance to detect the Attainment’s effect, since it is based entirely on external observation rather than telepathic intrusion. Modifiers for distant memories might apply, but memories or experiences that significantly contributed to the target’s development (such as child abuse or the death of an important figure) might actually grant bonuses, even if the target has repressed them.</div><div>The third Attainment of the Legacy allows the Sphinx to exert some influence over the world’s meanings. Very few Sphinxes progress to this point, because most of them focus more on discovering what being or phenomenon is responsible for the meaning of the world.

Before recorded history, the Legacy’s progenitors huddled in the hinterlands beyond the ruins of Atlantis, contemplating the doom of their kind. With Supernal senses, they saw the wreckage of the heavens and newly distant constellations of occult power.</div><div>This was not as it should have been. How did prophecies fail a nation of oracles? Awakened refugees searched for the answer. They found it when they found the Three. They learned that their homeland’s fall was overdue. Thread Cutters learned to measure the proper span of lives, master the calculus of punishment and bring about the end of men, women, ideas and kingdoms. Thread Cutters believe that all things have an appointed purpose and ending time. Should any being twist that purpose or defy that end, that being must be corrected — even killed. This is why mages call Thread Cutters Euthanists. Sometimes the title is ironic; Thread Cutters are not always gentle and, once convinced of the rightness of an action, never merciful.</div><div>Thread Cutters are dedicated to what they believe are natural laws. To violate one’s purpose or live beyond one’s destined ending is a crime against nature. Atlantis turned into a bloated tyranny that tried to extend its life on the backs of the gods. This crime wounded Creation itself; the Legacy preserves what’s left. Euthanists believe that all other laws are subservient to this so-called Mahadharma. The customs of a Consilium or order is of no consequence if the customs must be violated for the sake of the Great Law. </div><div>The Legacy’s faithful believe that they are duty bound (Indian members call it their dharma) to force people and institutions to fulfill their “true purpose” — but only for as long as Fate decrees that they should exist. Thread Cutters define this as the ability of the subject to do his, her or its duty without causing undue harm. The Legacy has a reputation for solving problems with torture and assassination, but the truth of the matter is that most of the Thread Cutters’ work is nonviolent. Destroying a decrepit corporation through bankruptcy is easier than killing.</div><div>Thread Cutters hail from many, far-flung cultures, but most are profoundly influenced by Indo-European mythology. The first Euthanists followed Indo-European migration. The Legacy’s beliefs evolved alongside those of the Indians, Iranians, Greeks and Celts, but whether mages inspired the people or vice versa may never be known. In any event, the Legacy reveres what it believes to be the archetypes behind these peoples’ most ancient gods. The Legacy as a whole calls them the Three, but individual sects give them local names.</div><div>The Three are manifestations of the Mahadharma. In cosmic roles, they are the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer. In the context of individual lives, they are Maiden, Mother and Crone, or Weaver, Measurer and Cutter. When pressed to find a culture-neutral term, Thread Cutters call them Beginning, Being and Ending. The Three can be male or female. They wear as many masks as needed, sending these avatars to offer revelations to the devout. In such guises, the Three visited the first Euthanists and charged them with preserving the Great Law.</div><div>Thread Cutters do not believe that the Three are gods in the sense of being powerful, immortal individuals. They may show themselves in that fashion, but in truth, each is a living cosmic principle that is endowed with a vast intelligence and limitless power. Despite their might, the Three do not break their own rules; to deal with those who would abuse and twist the Great Law, the Three need free-willed humans.</div>",

Even so, a known Euthanist is unlikely to ever reach a high station within the order because of fears that her dedication to the Mahadharma will conflict with Guardian agendas. The order prefers to let Thread Cutters work in their own cabals, isolated from other Guardians. Even so, there are many times when Guardian and Thread Cutter ideologies mesh. Euthanist Guardians earn more honor than trust, but that honor is considerable.<div>Otherwise, the only other order that openly deals with Thread Cutters is the Free Council. Thread Cutters have deep, long-lived ties to Fallen World civilizations and are not especially enamored of Atlantean pomp. Plus, the Legacy concerns itself with Sleepers’ well-being as a matter of course. Nevertheless, the Euthanists follow their own dharmas, and are willing to break any agreement that gets in the way. The Legacy’s more cold-blooded tactics also dissuade Libertines from getting too involved.</div><div>The Silver Ladder and Adamantine Arrow believe the Legacy is despicable. Théarchs have no tolerance for mages who would ignore Lex Magica whenever it suits them, and Arrow mages don’t like to deal with habitual oath-breakers. Members of both orders rarely agree with the Euthanists’ intimation that Atlantis deserved to die. Still, Thread Cutters have joined these orders before. Théarchs and Arrows appreciate that the Legacy tends to cull the weaknesses out of the organizations they join.</div><div>Thread Cutters have little interest in the Mysterium, but the reverse is not true. The order’s scholar-mages are fascinated (if mostly ignorant) of the Legacy’s philosophy and magical theories. Finally, a significant number of Thread Cutters are apostates. Some Lineages have been submerged within particular societies for so long that Atlantis and the finding of the Three is less important than its members’ modern roles as priests and gurus.</div>",
        "appearance": "Thread Cutters avoid undue attention whenever possible, but they do tend to adopt a simple, reserved style. Their interest in destiny makes them sensitive to how their appearance and speech may affect others. Even an innocent statement or affectation may bring important consequences through a social “domino effect.” Thread Cutter ritual garb comes from whatever culture a Legacy member identifies with. Many Euthanists use bone magical tools to represent impermanence and flowers to symbolize birth and renewal. Vestments tend to be somber.",

Prospective Thread Cutters often Awaken with a sense of shock and despair. They’ve discovered that the world is a lie and that malevolent, intelligent powers twist it to their desires.<div>Thrust into such a world, these mages find little comfort within the paranoid, duplicitous milieu of Awakened society. Men and women duel to the death over the most abstract secrets, all the while claiming to do it in the name of spiritual enlightenment or salvation for all. If a mage can’t stand the corruption and wishes to cleave to a higher law, the Legacy might find him.</div><div>Attaining the soul of a Thread Cutter comforts these mages. They find a purpose that is intolerant of evil, objective and, after a fashion, compassionate. A Euthanist’s duties are dangerous and imperil the spirit, but at least they serve a noble end.</div>",

Matters of station mean little; the only divisions are between partial initiates (or shravaki) who are trusted enough to be allowed to attend, full Euthanists (chelas) and masters (pramatars). Order rankings are irrelevant, as are all intermediary marks of distinction.<div>In these meetings, members discuss their current projects, settle any disputes that may arise during the course of their work and share the lore of the Legacy with one another. Moral support takes up no small part of these gatherings. Only a master (pramatar is Sanskrit for “judge”) or three initiated chelas may interfere with another Thread Cutter’s work. In the most formal situations, the Legacy holds a trial consisting of a pramatar judge, one chela as prosecutor and one as defender. Thread Cutters know that assuming the role of executioner and fate-twister goes hand-in-hand with severe temptation, and watch each other closely to keep themselves from acting for themselves over Mahadharma.</div><div>As many Thread Cutters are also Guardians of the Veil, many Thread Cutters also cultivate cults and secret societies according to the Labyrinth customs of Guardian tradition. Thread Cutters make great use of these in their mission to fulfill the Mahadharma, but are quick to punish those who would treat death lightly. Thread Cutter Labyrinths are marked by stringent codes of honor and reverence for life, but also carefully delineated situations where murder is permissible.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>Thread Cutters trace their origins to the first Atlantean exiles. While most of the Awakened refugees set their sights on survival first, the forebears of the Legacy looked inward. They wanted to understand why Atlantis fell. The Legacy’s first guru (whose name is lost to time) Awakened with knowledge of the Three. He (or she) demonstrated the attainments of his soul and codified the Thread Cutters’ teachings. At his command, the first Euthanists became ascetics and beggars.</div><div>The Euthanists believe that they journeyed to every corner of the world, but as far as they know, the only successful settlements lived among ancient peoples in the Ukraine and Asia Minor. Unlike many exiles, the Thread Cutters threw themselves at the mercy of the Sleepers. The rough tribes the Thread Cutters encountered remembered Atlantean raids and conquests. They treated mages harshly, forcing them to live among offal and corpses. Over the centuries, the Thread Cutters’ ancestors found a place within these tribes, performing “unclean” tasks such as burials and butchery.</div><div>About 5,000 years ago, the herdsmen and warriors that Thread Cutters followed began to settle South Asia and Europe. Archeologists would call these settlers the Indo European peoples. They spawned hundreds of related languages and religions. Bound to these diverse beliefs were the Three. Euthanists worshipped them under many names, but the Sleepers of Europe themselves treated the Three as ambivalent or evil figures, as necessary as they were terrible. South Asian civilizations gave the Three a higher place, as manifestations of one God. Accordingly, Thread Cutters acquired influence</div><div>in South Asia that persists to the present day. Otherwise, Euthanists spoke for the dark forces that threaten the thunder and sun gods of a thousand people’s pantheons. Even though the Indo European peoples turned to monotheism and philosophy, its Sleepers remembered the Three and told tales of the witches who did the work of the Three. When Shakespeare wrote of three “weird sisters” in the doom of Macbeth, he invoked the shadow of the Thread Cutters.</div><div>When the British Empire destroyed the Thugee cult, the British did so with the approval of the Euthanists, who wanted to see the fall of a conspiracy that had outlived its purpose. Kali, manifestation of Ending, needed subtler servants.This brings us to the modern age, when Thread Cutters hide among mages, doing their secret work for the benefit of all. Euthanists claim partial credit for a diverse, strong Awakened community because they “cut out the rot,” but that is not their entire goal. They simply do what is necessary. The great orders, the old philosophies and the mightiest nations of the world are slipping into old age. One day, the Legacy may judge that some of the core institutions of the Sleepers and Wise are at their Ending.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Cults of the Three</h3><div>The Thread Cutters are a truly ancient Legacy. Initiates contemplate the paradox of a Legacy that is obsessed with impermanence, yet has survived, continuously, for at least 7,000 years. Euthanist pramatars say that the Thread Cutters renew themselves by adapting to their environment.</div><div>Calling the Three by their universal names is rare; the Legacy prefers the names they have within Sleeper faiths and myths. Bereft of a memory of Atlantis, Sleepers constantly reinvent themselves. Thread Cutters use this cultural dynamism to renew their own organization, learning a little more about the Three through the faces they present to the world. Some Thread Cutters are so ensconced in their own faiths that they barely recognize foreign comrades, but even after millennia of adaptation, most of them can identify one another through certain secret signs and beliefs.</div><div>Following Indo European migration, the Legacy has formed a number of distinct cults, fellowships and ancestral cabals. The following three have the broadest reach; mages might find their adherents anywhere in the world.</div><ul><li><b>Aided:</b> Propelled by the Celtic revival, Aided (“Death”) mages recruit a larger percentage of Euthanists now than at any other point in their known history. The Aided can reliably trace their history back at least 800 years, and that limit only exists because their accounts grow unreliable past that point. Aided see the Three in the Triple Goddess, and specifically where she destroys heroessuch as Cú Chulaind. Similar to the Morrigan, Aided make great use of entangled Geasa (magical bans) and Buada (blessings) to work magic. Aided mages value treachery and twisted oaths as tools to secure an Ending and deplore mere “Craft,” or magic used to serve a selfish end. This puts them at odds with a number of other Celtic magical societies, including the Daoine (see Legacies: The Sublime, pp. 33–42) and the Sodality of the Tor (ibid, pp. 83–94). The Aided have no ill-will toward the Tor, but hate the Daoine’s cavalier approach to Fate.</li><li><b>Devasu:</b> The Devasu (“Divine Arrow”) take their name from the arrows of Rudra, aspect of Shiva and lord of disease. At 1,000 years of age, the current cult is the successor of an older cult called the Sapindya Satandanda (“Consanguinity of Eternal Joy”) that destroyed itself when its members believed that it had reached its own Ending. Members are tantric practitioners who believe that defying Ending blocks cosmic shakti: the living energy of creation. The Devasu praxis concerns the divine attributes of deities from the Vedas and Bhagavad-Gita. Through self-purification, these mages become manifestations (avataras) of these gods on Earth. Of all the Euthanist cults, the Devasu may be the most ritualistic, advocating specific forms of Ending for members of various professions, temples and businesses. The cult harvests Mana from these acts.</li><li><b>Eumenides:</b> The “Kindly Ones” style themselves after the Furies of Greek and Roman mythology and consider themselves to be the servants of the Fates. Various Greco Roman cults have existed throughout Thread Cutter history. The Eumenides trace their roots to a hidden society of Greek nobles. In the mid-18th century, these aristocrats revived Classical traditions within their secret rites. In their hunger for more occult knowledge, they opened a Cretan tomb containing the secrets of the Legacy. The cult has since discovered that this is the way of things: Greek branches of the Thread Cutters discover the secrets of their ancestors, take up the banner of the Fates and meet their doom a few centuries later — but not before leaving their own secrets for successors.</li></ul><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>The roots of Thread Cutter beliefs are the Three: divine concepts that guide the cycle of birth and death. Everything has a purpose and natural lifespan. Thread Cutters use their Arts, Attainments and philosophy to divine what a person or thing’s purpose is, whether it is fulfilling that aim and whether or not it should continue to exist. Most Euthanists concentrate on particular types of people or institutions. One might study financial institutions and another, police officers. But Thread Cutters don’t limit themselves to their special interests. If they see a life out of balance, they do what they can to correct it.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Euthanists’ Dharma</h3><div>Thread Cutters use a term from Indian spirituality — dharma — to describe the inherent purpose all beings have. Euthanists know what their dharma is: to change and destroy according to the Mahadharma. Mahadharma teaches them to analyze a situation, categorize its current place among the Three and, when necessary, how to intervene.</div><div>A person or organization can be enmeshed in Beginning, Being and Ending. If the subject is in the cycle of Beginning, it’s the mage’s duty to ensure his (or her, or its) growth. Outsiders rarely talk about how Euthanists cure sick children or use magic to give a struggling new business a windfall, but these interventions are quite common. This is not always a function of raw age. A young child with an incurable illness can be at the cusp of Ending. An old man, freed from his life’s obligations, may embark on a new Beginning as an artist. Euthanists not only remove impediments to new growth, but ensure that subjects follow their true purpose. They remove criminals that would corrupt a new business, or might spirit a young woman far away from a destructive family or community.</div><div>A mature subject enters the phase of Being, where the subject must cleave closely to its dharma. Thread Cutters believe a proper dharma consists of the subject’s aspirations combined with the prospect that he will benefit those ensnared in his destiny. There is a delicate balance between these elements. A business that means well but cripples local economic health is acting against its dharma; a murderer whose victims would have gone on to kill or corrupt is following his true dharma. If a subject violates his dharma, Euthanists employ a series of escalating tactics to correct him. These start with methods by which the mage acts indirectly, foiling the target’s plans, turning friends against him and offering rewards for correct actions. If these fail, Euthanists take a direct hand in affairs. They use threats, torture, blackmail and other extreme tools to achieve their aim.</div><div>If even this fails, the subject is irreparable; he, she or it has come to the time of Ending. That is the nature of this cycle, for Ending is the time when a person or organization is no longer fit to do its duty. Sadly, too many people refuse to let go of their failed ambitions and ruined lives, so it falls to the Thread Cutters to set things right. The Legacy is infamous for their murderous, destructive acts, but most of these are carefully considered. It isn’t always necessary to destroy the subject, but total renewal, while a fine ideal, is difficult to achieve. Euthanists often deal with psychopaths, servants of the Abyss and blood-drinking monsters and have no compunctions about putting them out of their misery.</div><div>Thread Cutters prefer to inflict painless deaths, but as most Thread Cutters believe in reincarnation, the type of Ending is important. Some Legacy members believe that various forms of corruption merit specific Endings by fire, water, a blade or strangulation. For example, the Devasu cult holds that it is best to kill a holy man by opening the top of his skull. Temples to certain gods must fall to fire; others, to flood.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Knives Behind the Throne</h3><div>Needless to say, Thread Cutters’ actions do not sit well with other mages. Awakened society values its laws. They ensure a measure of liberty and peace among people who might otherwise kill each other with a wrathful chant, gesture or even a thought. The Euthanists respect the Lex Magica only as far as it suits them, ignoring it to dispatch mages to their Endings or otherwise meddle in prohibited affairs.</div><div>Thus, mages who value law and order distrust Thread Cutters. As a result, the Legacy is a secret society among secret societies. Most Thread Cutters are nominal members of the Guardians of the Veil, but only serve the order’s political agenda as far as it suits their own esoteric aims. This isn’t to say that the Euthanists are unheard of. In fact, Thread Cutters loom large in legends, where they kill and torture arrogant mages — or mages who break strange, faerie tale rules. Despite this, few mages have knowingly met a member of the Legacy. Thread Cutters know their reputations (and some use them quite effectively over the course of their duties) and keep a low profile. In effect, they are willing outcasts, unable to share the fullness of their doctrine with others. Thread Cutters usually make an effort to avoid murder and violence and will counsel potential targets to avoid a “bad end,” but never in such a way that they would reveal their Legacy-driven motives.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Left-Handed?</h4><div>Thread Cutters figure in well known stories, but living members of the Legacy rarely reveal themselves. The stories paint the Thread Cutters as the rigid executioners of moral laws or as capricious killers and meddlers, punishing victims for infractions they didn’t know existed.</div><div>As a consequence, there is no consensus as to whether the Legacy is acceptable or “Left-Handed.” When Thread Cutters have revealed themselves, they’ve provided considerable help, but were so cavalier about the Lex Magica that many of them were punished with death or exile.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Thread Cutters use the Three as the model for Thread Cutter training. A newly Awakened mage serves the Beginning. Reborn into enlightenment, she explores her new world. Tutors let new mages explore their powers and perceptions freely, because their charges are experiencing a burst of creative power that they will never feel again.</div><div>After a mage begins formal occult study, she passes into the realm of Being. She tempers her raw power with discipline. Normally, her tutor teaches her the Mysteries alongside the beliefs of the Euthanists. At this stage, the tutor encourages his charge to develop an alternate identity. This protects her and gives her a refuge (a “normal life”) within the world of Being, while, over time, she learns to serve the cause of Ending. Eventually, a Thread Cutter learns the occult beliefs, ethics and techniques of the Legacy, and it is time to fully enter the Way of Ending. Full initiation entails a form of temporary death called the Agama (“revelation”). This is a rote that suspends the target’s life and plunges her soul into the Underworld. Bound to a ghostly form, she searches for the lost path to Stygia. No mage has successfully mapped this route, but it is said that the closer one gets, the more one learns from the journey.</div><div>As many Thread Cutters are Guardians of the Veil, tutors often integrate the order and Legacy initiations into one ordeal. In this case, the study of Being occurs alongside the Crimson Veil, and the Agama rite occurs after passing through the Black Veil. See Mage: The Awakening (pp. 44–46) and Guardians of the Veil for more information about the Veils of initiation.</div><div>Experienced mages are not required to pass through the Beginning stages of training, and take their old lives as their Being identities. Thus, an experienced initiate (pupils usually require a Gnosis of 3 and third-degree Disciple status, with Fate or Death as one of the Disciple-level Arcana) can pass through initiation in a matter of months, but must still endure the Agama rite. Only fully initiated mages are allowed to perform the Legacy’s work. They have passed into full knowledge of Endings.</div>",

Remember, however, that the Euthanist must impose these conditions when she uses the power, and that they are primarily a product of her opinion, not a special capacity for understanding the target’s true purpose.

The Thread Cutter rolls Resolve + Empathy + Fate — the target’s Composure. The Attainment costs one point of Mana to use.</div><div>The penalties of Monkey’s Paw apply to (almost) every tool the target uses. Furthermore, they also apply to social actions that rely on an organization and not the target’s raw force of personality. For example, the target could fast talk an official at the DMV without any special hindrances, but any forms he files might be lost, tagged for investigation or routed to his enemies. In game terms, this affects rolls that relate to Contacts, Fame and Status Merits. In conjunction with Fame, the Attainment can be particularly disastrous, because is affects nearly every social interaction. The target becomes the subject of a scandal, gets thrashed by the critics and otherwise becomes a figure of scorn. Fortunately, famous people benefit from the metaphysical “weight” imposed by others’ expectations, so Fame provides a bit of protection against the power. Each dot of the target’s Fame background imposes a –1 penalty to the Thread Cutter’s roll.</div><div>Similar to Preserve the Thread’s Measure, Sever Thread allows Thread Cutters to add conditions that will negate the Attainment.

These conditions are usually actions the target could take to demonstrate that he has “turned over a new leaf,” for example, returning stolen property or performing a specific act of self-sacrifice.</div><div>Remember that Sever Thread does not penalize the target’s direct interactions with the world. A gun might explode in his hands, but he can still use his fists effectively. The mayor’s office might not return his calls, but the target will be as persuasive as ever in a face-to-face meeting. Allies and Retainers are still reliable unless the target uses an intermediary to communicate with them.

When the Atlanteans raised the Celestial Ladder and ascended bodily to the Supernal World, they created a myth that would last forever. From the Tower of Babel to the Apollo Program, humanity has sought to storm the heavens once more.</div><div>The Legacy that calls itself the Thrice-Great claims it wants to bridge the Abyss and follow the Exarchs and Oracles beyond the sky. The Thrice-Great began during the Hellenistic period between the conquests of Alexander and the Roman Empire. In this period, Greek philosopher-scientists tried to devise a rational model of the universe.</div><div>The resulting system received its definitive statement by the astronomer Claudius Ptolemy. The Earth, he said, occupied the center of the universe. Around the Earth, concentric crystal spheres carried the Sun, Moon, planets and finally the fixed stars. In this “Ptolemaic” system, mystics saw more than a convenient model for predicting eclipses and casting horoscopes.</div><div>They saw a Celestial Ladder. Each crystal sphere was another rung between Earth and the imperishable stars where the Supreme Godhead dwelled. Sleeper mystics tried to climb this ladder through visions, rituals and appeals to the gods and spirits of each planet. The founders of the Thrice-Great understood that the stars were merely a symbol for the Supernal World; they tried to Ascend by way of the Shadow Realm and the planetary spirits who dwelled there. They did not beg or pray, either. The Thrice-Great believed that a mage who found the right formulas could command, and the gods themselves would obey. These forceful mages, true followers of the Path of the Mighty, therefore became experts at dealing with spirits. They believed (or discovered) that each planet bore mystic affinities to phenomena on Earth: plants, animals, parts of the human body, gemstones, metals, colors, musical tones and numbers. By adding these substances and qualities to their spells, they could attract the forces and spirits of a particular planet — and compel them.</div><div>The Thrice-Great called their mystical doctrine Hermeticism, after the god of passage between worlds. A simplified, bastardized form of Hermeticism became known to would-be wizards among the Sleepers, and has influenced Sleeper occultism to this day. The complete and true doctrine remains hidden, carefully preserved by the mages who use its methods to become mighty in three worlds: the material world, the Shadow Realm and — they hope — the Supernal World beyond.</div>",

The association is old and strong enough that the théarchs now teach the Legacy to mages of any Path, not just its Obrimos creators. The Mysterium also holds a fair number of Hermetics who seek the keys to command the planetary spirits and Ascend to the Supernal World. The Guardians of the Veil have a history of clashes with the Thrice-Great, but a few Stargazers help the order monitor the Sleeper occultists who study Hermetic lore leaked long ago. These Thrice-Great recruit any who show real mystic talent and steer the rest away from the genuine Mysteries.<div>The Thrice-Great’s ritualist approach to magic discourages members of the Adamantine Arrow from joining the Legacy. Mages in the Free Council often think the tradition-bound, elitist Thrice-Great embody everything the Libertines don’t like about the Atlantean orders: they Libertines don’t try to join, and no Thrice-Great has yet become a Libertine.</div>",

Hermetics of either sex tend to wear low-key jewelry made from different metals and semiprecious stones, using images appropriate for particular planets. For instance, a Thrice-Great might wear a copper pin shaped like a swan: copper and swans are both associated with Venus. Such jewelry isn’t magical — but makes an acceptable offering to planetary spirits, if the Stargazer must summon them on the fly.",

They can afford to craft the occasional talisman of precious metals and gems, not to mention acquiring a diverse assortment of plants, animal parts, perfumes and other substances associated with each planet and pleasing to its spirits. Hermetics see themselves as the underappreciated intelligentsia of the magical world, and the Legacy tends to attract people who already held that attitude before they Awakened.

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>The Stargazers believe their Hermetic doctrine began with a figure called Hermes Trismegistos, “Thrice-Great Hermes.” Hellenistic mystics identified the Greek god Hermes with the Egyptian god of magic, Thoth. By the later Roman period, mystics said Hermes Trismegistos was a mortal wizard and prophet — the first prophet in fact, whose doctrine was older (and therefore more authoritative) than other mystic stalwarts such as Moses and Zoroaster. The Stargazers say, however, that Thrice-Great Hermes was fully historical: Sleeper history knows him as the Greek astronomer Hipparchos, who lived from 190 to 120 BC.</div><div>Hipparchos is one of the key figures in the history of astronomy. Orthodox history does not describe him as mystic, but even Sleeper historians have recently figured out that he triggered a religious revolution. Hipparchos discovered the precession of the equinoxes: that the point in the zodiac where the sun rises at the start of spring and autumn slowly moves, taking 26,000 years to make a complete circle. This incidentally means the celestial pole isn't constant, either. It slowly traces a circle in the sky, so one star after another becomes the pole star. In Hipparchos' time, the Sun rose in the constellation of Aries, the Ram, at the spring equinox, but 2,000 years before, the Sun rose in Taurus, the Bull. And in a century or two, the Sun would rise in Pisces, the Fishes. The sunrise at equinox currently approaches the constellation of Aquarius, the Water-Carrier.</div><div>In the Ptolemaic model, the entire universe spun around the Earth, completing one circuit each day. The Sun, Moon and planets moved more slowly against this daily background. The system was self-contained. Hipparchos discovered a grander motion superimposed on the system. Some force was tipping the entire universe, making it wobble like a top about to fall!</div><div>When Claudius Ptolemy recorded Hipparchos’ discovery, Ptolemy simply described the precession of the equinoxes as a fact, without trying to explain it. Mystics saw the hand of the Supreme Godhead — no longer dwelling inside the universe but beyond it, turning the cosmos and bending the path of the poles.</div><div>The Thrice-Great say that Hipparchos himself Awakened when he realized some force must exist outside the cosmos he could observe. Over the years, he learned the star-magic of Mesopotamia and the god-magic of Egypt, and then quested into the Shadow Realm to find the spirits of the planets. He Ascended the celestial spheres to the sphere of the stars and cried out, demanding to pass and face the One Beyond.</div><div>Hipparchos received an answer from the Oracle of the Golden Key itself, whom the Thrice-Great call Aion. The Oracle gave Hipparchos the powers of the Legacy and told him how to use his Attainments. Aion also explained the affinities that still linked the material, planetary and Supernal realms. The astronomer returned from his celestial voyage as Thrice-Great Hermes, the Oracle’s own messenger to the Fallen World. The Thrice-Great say their founder never truly died, but climbed the Planetary Ladder again and jumped across the Abyss to the Supernal World.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Thrice-Great During the Roman Empire</h3><div>Hipparchos’ discoveries, both astronomical and metaphysical, spread far beyond the Legacy he founded. The early Thrice-Great did not keep their doctrines secret. In fact, they tried to teach every educated, philosophically minded person they could find, in hopes they would Awaken as Hipparchos. After so many centuries, of course, the modern Thrice-Great have little hard evidence of their forebears’ activities, but modern Thrice-Great point to circumstantial evidence of the Legacy’s influence.</div><div>The far-flung but secretive religion of Mithraism, for instance, built temples filled with astronomical symbolism. Thrice-Great tradition holds that the central Mithraic image, of the god killing a bull, represented the shift of the equinox from Taurus to Aries.</div><div>The Gnostics — diverse offshoots from Christianity and Judaism — believed that evil, false gods held souls prisoner in an evil, false world. Some Gnostics associated these false gods with the deities of the planetary spheres. The true god dwelt outside the realms of matter, spirit and the visible heavens.</div><div>In each written dialogues of the Corpus Hermeticum, a divine figure tells an eager mortal how souls come from a higher, purer realm. Salvation involves understanding one’s connection to this greater reality.</div><div>The Chaldean Oracles tell how to contact and summon gods and spirits through their affinities to plants, animals, stones and other material things. No one now can say how much of the Thrice-Great methods the Chaldean Oracles revealed: only fragments of the book survive through quotations by other writers. The Guardians of the Veil say they worked for centuries to suppress the Chaldean Oracles. If they still own any copies, they certainly won’t admit it.</div><div>The purest statement of Thrice-Great ideas to Sleepers came through the Neoplatonist mystics of the fourth through sixth centuries AD. The Neoplatonists combined philosophy with magic rituals from the Chaldean Oracles. Indeed, the Thrice-Great say many of these now-obscure mystics were members of their Legacy.</div><div>The Neoplatonists insisted on sticking to Greek religious forms after the Roman Empire made Christianity the state religion. The Thrice-Great Legacy died out in Europe with the suppression of the last Neoplatonic academy. Nevertheless, the Stargazers regard the Neoplatonist movement as their Legacy’s golden age. They seek to recover lost works by their Neoplatonist forebears, for many Thrice-Great believe several of these Awakened philosophers matched Hipparchos’ epic journey and brought back powerful secrets about the planetary spirits and the Supernal World.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Medieval Hiatus</h3><div>After the suppression of the Neoplatonists, the Thrice-Great survived in secret among scholars of the new Muslim empire. Unfortunately, while Muslim savants preserved a great deal of Classical astronomy and philosophy, Islam was no friendlier than Christianity to the idea of planetary spirits. The Legacy, and its lore about planetary spirits, declined simply because it was hard for members to find each other, share information and assist in training each others’ pupils. Still, Muslim Stargazers added a few texts to the Corpus Hermeticum.</div><div>The Thrice-Great achieved a few small revivals in this period, though. Most notably, Legacy members gathered at the court of Ulugh Begh, in 15th-century Samarkand. Astronomy fascinated this grandson of the conqueror Timur. His observatory compiled the most accurate star tables and calculations of planetary motion the world had yet seen. Under cover of this research, the Thrice-Great restored contact with many powerful spirits of the planets. The mages who currently occupy the Legacy’s hidden sanctum, however, are not Thrice-Great and refuse to let modern Hermetics search for lost secrets of their forebears.</div><div>Meanwhile, the Thrice-Great Legacy filtered back into Europe along with the rest of Classical learning. By the 15th century, European mages actively sought to reclaim the secrets of Greek and Roman willworkers. Sleepers also rediscovered the Corpus Hermeticum, much to the Guardians of the Veil’s collective annoyance.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>A Troubled Transition</h3><div>The leading figures of this Hermetic Revival gathered in Italy. The Sleeper Classicist and mystic Marsilio Ficino almost let the Hermetic Mysteries escape through his translations and commentaries on the Corpus Hermeticum, but he misunderstood what he read through his lack of an Awakened perspective. His Awakened readers, however, recognized what he got wrong and sought corrected information.</div><div>Some of these new Thrice-Great wanted to spread the word as badly as their Neoplatonist forebears. The Legacy’s most determined publicist for this period was surely the magus Fabio Paolini, whose Hebdomades described in explicit detail how to evoke planetary spirits and draw on their power for willworking. The Guardians of the Veil retaliated with Cornelius Agrippa’s Three Books of Occult Philosophy, meant to lay out the Guardians’ usual deluding mix of incomplete truths and convincing lies. Agrippa was not as good a pawn as the Guardians hoped. His work revealed more of the truth than the Guardians intended. On the other hand, a few Sleepers every century Awaken from dabbling with Agrippa’s methods; the Thrice-Great sometimes list Agrippa as their pawn, if they feel like annoying Guardian colleagues.</div><div>Just as Europe’s new Hermetics congratulated themselves on recovering ancient powers, a Polish bishop pulled the rug out from their enterprise. Nicolaus Copernicus’ argument that everything revolved around the Sun, not the Earth, rocked the mystical and scientific communities as thoroughly as Hipparchos’ discoveries had done 16 centuries before. No one took it worse than the Thrice-Great. If the Earth was merely one planet among other planets, what did that do to the crystal spheres and spirit realms that Thrice-Great doctrine called the remains of the Celestial Ladder?</div><div>Each century after Copernicus brought new shocks. Galileo found moons around Jupiter, something never revealed by centuries of Thrice-Great dealings with Jovian spirits. During the 18th century, William Herschel discovered a new planet, eventually named Uranus, which had never appeared in Hermetic plans. The stars didn’t occupy a crystal shell; they were distant suns. Nineteenth-century astronomers found the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, then Neptune orbiting beyond Uranus. The 20th century brought Pluto, a tiny world whose madcap orbit sometimes brought it within the orbit of Neptune. By the century’s end, Pluto was demoted from planet to the largest known member of the Kuiper Belt of icy planetoids, with an inconceivably vast Oort Cloud of other small, icy bodies beyond that.</div><div>The Legacy’s official response to each new discovery has been to ignore it. All the discoveries of modern astronomy, the Thrice-Great leaders declared, are but deceptions placed by the Exarchs. Before the fall of Atlantis, Earth was the center of the universe, the planets did ride on crystal spheres and the planetary spirit courts in the Shadow Realm do occupy the surviving rungs of the Celestial Ladder. This attitude, unfortunately, made the Thrice-Great into dogmatic foes of the mages who would form the Free Council. Bad feeling persists on both sides.</div><div>The sheer diversity of magical doctrines now available to contemporary mages also erodes the Thrice-Great’s claims to ancient authority. The Hermetics certainly wield great power, but not enough to render them clearly superior to other Legacies. The Hermetics’ methods are also undeniably cumbersome. The Legacy enjoyed a surge in recruitment during the 1960s, when interest in astrology made newly Awakened mages receptive to the Thrice-Great’s claims of ancient wisdom. Recruitment dropped off again, however, and the Legacy is clearly in decline. After 2,000 years of reaching for the sky, will the Thrice-Great  finally crash to Earth?</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society</h2><div>The Thrice-Great hold a high opinion of themselves. All the Awakened are special people, of course — but how many Legacies formed through the direct command of an Oracle? An Oracle that continues to send messages to its disciples, the Thrice-Great say. The Stargazers claim Aion itself as the leader of their Legacy, with Hermes Trismegistos and other Ascended Masters, or Ipsissimi, as the Oracle’s assistants in the Supernal World.</div><div>Here in the Fallen World, however, the Legacy has no single leader. The head of each lodge takes the title of Pontifex. Each Pontifex has the Legacy’s third Attainment but otherwise achieves his office only by persuading other Hermetics to follow him and form a lodge. The Pontifices entice Hermetics from other lodges by bragging about the quantities of lore the lodge has gathered, the lodge’s influence in the planetary sprit courts, and their own power. The greatest boast for a Hermetic, of course, is to Ascend the ladder of planetary spheres and return with a new message from Aion. Such a Thrice-Great takes the title of Magister Caelestis.</div><div>Thrice-Great receive lesser titles based on their Attainments. A Hermetic with all three Attainments is a Dominus. The second Attainment brings the rank of Philosophus, while a Stargazer with only the first Attainment is a Practicus. Apprentices not yet initiated are addressed as Zelator. In formal communications (including lodge meetings), a Thrice-Great is expected to begin with another Hermetic’s rank in the Legacy, order and Arcana mastery: for instance, “Philosophus Deacon Chrysantius, Disciple in the Third Degree.” For the rest of the encounter, Thrice-Great may limit themselves to the other mage’s rank in the Legacy.</div><div>Stargazers typically choose shadow names in Greek or Latin, and assign such names to their apprentices. Shadow names may express some ideal or hoped-for achievement (such as Telephassa, “Far Shiner”), or just “classicize” a contemporary name (such as turning Kurtz into Curtius). Names of ancient philosophers and astronomers such as Anaxagoras or Hypatia are also used.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Celestial Power</h3><div>The Thrice-Great believe that as they gain Attainments, their souls become more similar to that of their patron Aion. This creates a sympathetic link between the Fallen World and Supernal World. The more of the Fallen World the Hermetics bring under their influence, the more easily Aion can reach into the mortal realm to spark more Awakenings. They also strengthen Aion’s position in the Supernal World: as below, so above.</div><div>As members of the Silver Ladder, Thrice-Great mages often seek influence in politics, business or other worldly institutions. A few Hermetics use their magic to advance their careers and gain social power directly. More often, though, a Hermetic stays in the background. Instead of becoming mayor or running a million-dollar business, the Stargazer works in the City Hall mailroom or at the coffee shop where the executives congregate. The mage nudges events through covert magic, sympathetic links or spirit minions. It’s less direct, but safer.</div><div>Thrice-Great also seek influence in the spirit courts associated with the planets. Thrice-Great know the rulers of each planetary court, whom they call Archons, will not help rebuild the Celestial Ladder — not unless the Thrice-Great force them somehow. Some Hermetics suspect the Archons may be trusties for the Exarchs. At the very least, Thrice-Great tutors say, the Archons do not care about human affairs or anything humans could comprehend.</div><div>Only an archmage could hope to bind an Archon. Fortunately, the planetary courts include spirits of every power level. The lesser gods wield enough power for most of a mage’s purposes. Legacy members build their power step-by-step, drawing minor planetary spirits to their service and using them as envoys to greater spirits. When a Hermetic cannot compel, he dickers and bribes until he can forge a lasting contract for particular services — and gain audience with the next tier of the spirit court.</div><div>Following the example set by the great Paolini, Hermetics call planetary spirits henads — “sevens” — to distinguish them from other spirits. Between the seven planetary courts, Thrice-Great can recruit henads with almost any Influence they need. Thrice-Great doctrine holds that to send a call across the Abyss, a mage needs backing from all seven planetary courts. A high-ranking henad must grant the mage an honorary rank in the court, increasing the mage’s authority over spirits of that planet. This special status comes with a new name the mage uses with spirits of that planet as a sort of password. When a Stargazer collects password-names from all seven courts, he may seek the final celestial realm, the sphere of the stars, and call to Aion.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Revelations from Aion</h3><div>Once a Thrice-Great possesses all three Attainments and all seven passwords to the planetary courts, she may climb the ladder of celestial spheres and seek a revelation from Aion. Thrice-Great tradition says some Celestial Masters returned with fourth Attainments — all different, all awesomely powerful. Others returned as archmages . . . and others did not return at all, because Aion pulled them into the Supernal World.</div><div>In verifiable, modern history, however, Aion’s revelations have proved less spectacular. A Celestial Master returns with merely a new rote — conveniently, for some feat of magic the Stargazer has already performed many times — or a useful tidbit of lore. Skeptics also suggest the communications from Aion seem less than divine in their wisdom. Exhortations to guide the Sleepers in the paths of wisdom and protect them from the Abyss and the Seers are high-minded enough but a bit . . . hackneyed, as if some merely human intellect tried to come up with something a superhumanly wise spiritual master ought to say.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>New Merit: Celestial Name (• to •••••••)</h4><div>When a planetary god gives a Stargazer a new name, it confers a minor, honorary rank in the spirit court of that planet. The new name acts as a password to enter that court: the mage still must obey all the court’s rules, but at least hostile henads may give the mage a chance to talk.</div><div>The Hermetic also gains a +1 bonus to all dice pools for interacting with spirits of that court, whether magically or socially. For instance, the mage gains the bonus to summon this class of henads, to compel them or banish them, or to attempts to persuade or negotiate with the spirits using mundane Skills. The Thrice-Great does not gain the bonus for outright attacks on the spirit (including use of the third Attainment).</div><div>Given time, power and successful negotiations with high-ranking spirits, a mage could parlay a Celestial Name into actual Status in the planetary court. This would confer greater authority over lower-ranking spirits but also mean obligations toward higher-ranking spirits, so Thrice-Great are cautious about pursuing this route. A Celestial Name is pure privilege. Status in multiple spirit courts also tends to cause conflicts of interest, while the point of Celestial Names is to collect them from all seven planetary courts.</div>",
        "magic": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2><div>The quick, on-the-fly spellcasting of Thrice Great mages looks much the same as that of any other willworker. They prefer wands and disks as Path tools. A Hermetic’s disk sometimes takes the form of an astrolabe (a device for measuring a star’s position; it looks like a disk with a crossbar for sighting). The defining tool for the Thrice-Great, however, is the strophados. This device consists of a golden ball on a cord. The mage swings the strophados to imitate the circling motion of the heavens. Thrice-Great generally engrave their strophados with a diagram and sigils representing the position of the planets at the time of their Awakening. A Thrice-Great strophados also unscrews so the mage can load it with substances sympathetic to the planet whose power or spirits she wants to invoke. The strophados is essential for extended spellcasting and is a favored tool for summoning planetary spirits or opening roads to the Shadow Realm.</div><div>Thrice-Great magic becomes most distinctive when these mages engage in extended casting in their sanctums. A Hermetic collects a wide range of substances with affinities to the planets, from bolts of colored cloth to body parts from different animals. For a full ritual, a Thrice-Great draws a magic circle marked with the signs of the zodiac and the current positions of the planets, with chords drawn to mark relationships such as opposition, trine, sextile and square.</div><div>The Hermetic strengthens the influence of planets that relate to his intended feat of magic by placing the proper substances on their sigils. The chamber of the ritual may also be hung with cloth of the proper color; corresponding perfumes scent the air. As part of the ritual, the Thrice-Great may also play notes associated with the planets he invokes, using a lyre or similar instrument. Especially long rites can include a chanted recitation of a hymn by the Greek poets Homer or Hesiod to a god associated with the planet. The Hermetic also swings the strophados. The total time spent whirling the strophados must exceed one time increment for extended spellcasting, as set by the mage’s Gnosis (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 76), so extended spellcasting can be quite strenuous for novice Stargazers.</div><div>This elaborate paraphernalia grants the Thrice-Great certain benefits to spellcasting. (They are not usually feasible for instant spellcasting.)</div><ul><li>All cooperative spellcasting by Thrice-Great mages gains a +1 bonus to teamwork rolls, as if they belonged to a symbolic cabal. This applies to instant as well as ritual spellcasting, but requires the use of at least three planetary correspondences.</li><li>Combined spellcasting is easier. Using at least five planetary affinities cancels the penalty for one spell in a combined casting. For instance, a Thrice-Great could cast two spells at once, without raising the effective Arcana ratings of the spells or suffering a –2 penalty to the dice pools for casting each spell. (This does not enable a Thrice-Great to cast more spells at once than his Gnosis would allow, though.)</li><li>At least three planetary affinities in a spell counters –1 dice of any other penalties to the mage’s spellcasting dice pool. Five affinities cancel 2 dice of penalty.</li><li>Use of at least three planetary correspondences reduces the Paradox dice pool by 1. Use of five affinities reduces the Paradox dice pool by 2. Other mages do not gain these benefits by using Hermetic methods and planetary correspondences: other mages’ souls lack a Thrice-Great’s sympathy for planetary energies.</li></ul><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Astrological Magic</h3><div>No one can say when humans first associated magic with the planets. By the Renaissance, Sleeper astrologers no longer believed the planets were actual gods moving around the sky. Instead, the planets radiated forces that made various events more or less likely — such as how the Moon controlled the tides, but more subtle. Mars, for instance, governed fire, war and disease. If Mars occupied particular signs of the zodiac or particular angles to other planets, people were more likely to quarrel, get sick or have their homes burn down.</div><div>The Thrice-Great now ascribe these arcane influences to the planetary courts. The tides of celestial power shift according to the planets’ locations and angles to each other in the sky, however, even though the power comes from the Shadow Realm instead of outer space.</div><div>Astrology, therefore, is real — at least if you’re Awakened. The Silver Ladder has initiated several Acanthus into the Thrice-Great. These mages use astrology for prophecy and fate-weaving. All Hermetic magic involves concentrating the mystic tides to bolster the mage’s spells.</div><div>Planetary Correspondences Thrice-Great use special substances and conditions to attract mystic energies from the planetary spirit courts. The character of each planet suggests Influences for its spirits and a range of magical feats it can empower. The planets do not correspond tidily to specific Arcana or Practices, however, so Thrice-Great (and their players) have some freedom in which planets they invoke in spellcasting.</div><div>The <b>Sun</b> is associated with magic of light (of course), energy, life-force, willpower, healing and augmentation of power. No surprise, the Sun is the favorite “planet” for Obrimos mages.</div><div>The <b>Moon</b> is the planet of transformation, illusion and everything changeable, from the element of water to emotions and magic itself.</div><div><b>Mercury</b> is associated with thought and motion: investigation and analysis as well as literal travel and exploration. Commerce, theft and divination also fall in this planet’s purview. Mercury’s element is Air.</div><div><b>Venus</b> governs living creatures, fertility, pleasure, love, friendship and all the softer emotions that bring people together. Venus’ element is Earth, but as the abode of life rather than solidity or stability.</div><div><b>Mars</b> is the planet of raw force, sometimes creative but often destructive, the element of fire, war, violent emotions and other disruptions. Mars also governs fever and blood. Venus seduces; Mars overwhelms.</div><div><b>Jupiter</b> is associated with the element of air and weather as well as politics, laws, morals, rulership and justice. Jupiter also governs money, religion and social power in general.</div><div><b>Saturn</b> is the planet of time, age, death and restriction. Saturn’s element is Earth, offering stability and defense as well as limitation or destruction.</div><div>Even Sleeper occultists know that gold and yellow correspond to the Sun, silver and white to the Moon, quicksilver and gray (or mottled colors) to Mercury, copper and green to Venus, iron and red to Mars, tin and blue to Jupiter and lead and black to Saturn. The jewels, animals, plants and other associations of each planet are too diverse to list. Pop-occult books give detailed (and contradictory) lists of planetary correspondences . . . but none should be trusted.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>New and Lost Planets</h3><div>A few Thrice-Great believe the asteroid belt represents a broken “rung” in the Celestial Ladder, while the “rungs” corresponding to Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were lost to the Abyss when the Ladder broke. A few other Hermetics believe the four missing spirit courts are now scattered, in hiding or imprisoned in some way. These Stargazers think the Celestial Ladder could be mended by restoring the lost spirit courts.</div><div>The majority of Thrice-Great, however, believe such plans are modern, revisionist nonsense. As they point out, tradition gives no correspondences to the asteroids or outer planets. Hermetic Tutors generally cut off “heretical” pupils. The situation might change if a heretic Stargazer could locate a spirit for one of the “new” planets, or could show some great benefit from creating such spirits.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Spirit Allies</h3><div>A great deal of Thrice-Great magic deals with summoning and controlling henads. The legacy’s masters of Spirit also create planetary spirits — and after more than 2,000 years, they’ve made significant additions to the planetary courts. Most Hermetics eventually gain henad associates of their own, and the Legacy as a whole claims a host of contacts and allies in the planetary courts. The Thrice-Great define three classes of allied spirits.</div><ul><li><b>Iynges</b> (singular Iynx) are personal familiars. A Thrice-Great can easily create a “feeding station” for a henad familiar using objects and conditions corresponding to the spirit’s planet. For instance, a spirit of Mars could gain Essence from a wolf’s head mounted on a cedar plaque over a fireplace, flanked by iron swords and with red candles on the mantelpiece; every day, the mage burns an appropriate incense.</li><li><b>Synocheis</b> (“Connectors”; singular, Synocheus) are henads bound to statues to create fetishes. A lodge can’t gain any respect unless it has several Synocheis. Not only do the fetish-statues provide the lodge with Paradox-free powers, the bound henads can contact other spirits and tell them of a Thrice-Great’s desire for an audience. When a lodge breaks up, much of the acrimony centers on who takes possession of the Synocheis. Creating a Synocheus involves placing substances sympathetic to the spirit’s planet within a hollow statue (called a telestika), as well as use of the “Create Fetish” spell. Synocheis can be represented as Imbued Items or as Retainers.</li><li><b>Teletarchs</b> (“Initiation Masters”) are the greater spirits allied to the Legacy as a whole, bound to respond when a Thrice-Great uses the proper formula. The mage must still persuade the Teletarch and offer it some consideration in return for its aid, just as a mortal Ally. Teletarchs are at least Rank 4, and they can carry appeals to more powerful henads. The formulas for contacting Teletarchs are so valuable that Pontifices and other senior Thrice-Great tend to keep them secret from lesser members — with the inevitable result that the Legacy has lost the protocols to contact many Teletarchs. These potent spirits would still respond, though, if any mage could rediscover the proper rites.</li></ul><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Initiation</h2><div>A candidate to join the Thrice-Great must first prove her knowledge of Platonist and Neoplatonist philosophy, naked-eye astronomy (enough competence to track the planets through the zodiac) and classical astrology. She must also demonstrate her ability to evoke planetary spirits and perform other magical feats in the Hermetic style. Her examination takes place at a lodge’s main sanctum, before a board of three Hermetics with a minimum rank of Philosophus. The Thrice-Great also call one of the lodge’s Teletarchs, who may ask whatever questions it pleases and examine the candidate’s aura. The divine spirit may veto the candidate’s application at this time, without any need to give a reason. The candidate can try again a year later, with a different Teletarch.</div><div>If the mages and patron god agree that the candidate deserves to join the Legacy, the senior Thrice-Great open a Verge in a special chamber. The lodge’s Synocheis are summoned to add their own auras, giving the ritual chamber the resonance of all seven planets. In this sacred space between material and spiritual, terrestrial and celestial, the tutor guides his pupil in a complex astrological ritual that shapes her soul. After the ceremony, each attending spirit receives a gift of Essence from the lodge.</div><div>The ritual to confer the second Attainment is very similar. A triumvirate of Domini, including the lodge’s Pontifex, verifies the Stargazer’s proficiency as a Disciple of Spirit. While they’re at it, they register his current competency at the other Arcana, too. As a final test, the Thrice-Great himself summons a Teletarch to witnesses the Stargazer’s graduation to the next Attainment. This is usually quite easy, since the divine spirit has been notified of the ceremony and is already nearby.</div><div>The ceremony of the third Attainment happens so rarely that a lodge’s entire membership may gather to witness the event. The ritual itself does not differ greatly from the previous Attainments. The new Dominus, however, ends the ceremony by giving out Essence to as many planetary spirits as wish to attend. The Thrice-Great consider it auspicious if the Dominus can use her new Attainment to convert the sanctum’s Hallow into a temporary locus, while the other Thrice-Great lower the sanctum’s wards and issue a call to every spirit in the area — an open house and all-you-can-eat spiritual feast. Such events remind the spirits and lodge members of their position as lords of the spirit world. For this reason, most Thrice-Great wait until they become Adepts of both Prime and Spirit before seeking their third Attainment.</div><div>The Thrice-Great hold firm doctrines about fourth Attainments. Such ultimate mastery comes not from any mortal rite but by contacting Aion. The Oracle itself confers a fourth Attainment, which may be different for each mage. As usual with fourth Attainments, however, no Thrice-Great in living memory has provably received this ultimate power.</div>",

This Attainment acts similar to the Spirit 2 “Place of Power” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 247) except the results are automatic. The Attainment also works at ley nodes, while the spell can only be used at Hallows. If two Hermetics cooperate, their uses of Celestial Beacon do not add; apply the results from the mage with the higher Spirit rating. If the Hermetics oppose each other, however, subtract the less-proficient mage’s Spirit rating from the change wrought by the mage with greater proficiency at Spirit.</div><div>From Twilight or the Shadow Realm, a Thrice-Great who lowers the Gauntlet seems to draw in waves of light that form a sparkling vortex, advertising the lowered Gauntlet to every spirit nearby.

Similar to the spell a Celestial Beacon emulates, a Celestial Beacon lasts one scene.</div><div>A Practicus can also see into Twilight.

Subtract the mage’s Spirit rating from the local Gauntlet strength to find how many turns it takes to open the Planetary Portal (a minimum of 1). At a ley node or Hallow, the Thrice-Great could use Celestial Beacon to weaken the Gauntlet first. As with Spirit Road, the Planetary Portal lasts only one turn. Anything longer requires actual spellcasting.</div><div>To mortal eyes, a Planetary Portal looks like a momentary, circular shimmer in the air. It could be a trick of the light, or a person’s imagination. From the Shadow Realm or Twilight, however, the ingathering spiritual vortex shines in coruscating hues: every Thrice-Great’s portal looks different, with colors set by the position of the planets at the time of her initiation into the Legacy. Any Thrice-Great (or someone else with spiritual perceptions and Occult proficiency) can figure out when a Hermetic received initiation through a successful Wits + Occult roll (difficulty 3), just by studying his Planetary Portal.</div>",

Unlike the liches, however, these mages do not destroy, consume or even remove the soul. Instead, they use it as a lens, a way to look into the Supernal and witness the glory of the idols of their worship, the Ones Before. The Echo Walkers believe that the “angels” in the Supernal Realm of Aether are actually the remnants of a proto-human first race. Most members of the Legacy refer to these beings as the “Ones Before,” but many Echo Walkers have their own theories or stories about what these beings are.</div><div>Some Echo Walkers consider the Ones Before to be true angels, others look to Biblical accounts of the Nephilim, children of man and angel. Some look to pre-Christian mythology and identify the Ones Before with the Titans or the giants of Norse creation myths. All agree, however, that these beings are unknowable in the Fallen World as it stands, and this truth pains them. They believe that the key lies in the noble soul of humanity, and they are quite willing to dislodge, prod and injure that soul to find it.</div>",

There are Consilii the world over that know about the Blinded, but they aren’t nearly as well recognized or feared as the Scelesti or the Tremere. As a result, the orders don’t have opinions about the Echo Walkers that could be considered a “party line.”<div>The Echo Walkers, however, claim membership in all five of the orders. In the Silver Ladder, they find access to other Obrimos, the better to pump them for information about their experiences of Aether. In the Adamantine Arrow, the Echo Walkers’ desire to emulate the Ones Before takes on a warrior’s code — the Elect look at their Supernal idols as teachers, deities and objects of protection (and, if necessary, martyrdom). Echo Walkers in the Free Council use the order’s connections with new learning and techné to try to find a scientific or at least modern understanding of the Ones Before. The Elect in the Mysterium pore over tomes, tomb markings and arcane riddles for just a hint as to the true nature of the inhabitants of the Aether.</div><div>The Guardians of the Veil provide a tanta lizing proposition to the Echo Walkers. If they can secure membership in the order, the Guardians’ mission of making sure that Sleepers aren’t exposed to magic unnecessarily gives the Elect a host of interesting test subjects. Of course, the Guardians also tend to deal most harshly with the Blinded when they find them.</div>",
        "appearance": "Echo Walkers are often healthy-looking and exuberant. This is partly a result of their studies of the Life Arcanum, but for the most part, their enthusiasm comes from their purposeful lives. An Echo Walker lives each day hoping to finally crack the final riddle and meet the Ones Before once again, and that notion fills her with joy and anticipation. Echo Walkers, despite their Left-Handed appellation, are some of the most positive and outgoing mages the Awakened could hope to meet, which is just one more reason that the Elect are so often overlooked.",
        "background": "The Obrimos who chooses to become an Echo Walker was typically a devout practitioner of one faith or another before her Awakening. A good number of the Elect, though, pick up such faith after their visit to the Aether.<div>Whenever they received their calling, such mages feel that the Awakened are missing something. Perhaps the mages feel that the orders put too much stock in stories of Atlantis, or maybe they think that using magic for day-to-day needs is disrespectful. The common thread is that these Theurgists feel the pull of something greater than they, some long-lost birthright to their Path. That birthright, of course, is the wisdom and power of the Ones Before.</div><div>It would be tempting to say that mages who join this Legacy aren’t very bright, or, at least, are weak-willed for placing their faith so blindly in such a legend. The truth, though, is that many Echo Walkers are intelligent, well educated and quite lucid. They simply believe in the Ones Before, and so their actions, however deplorable another mage might find them, are reasonable to the Elect. That’s small consolation to the Sleepers whose souls the Blinded push out of joint for a bare glance at glory, of course.</div>",
        "organizzation": "While the Echo Walkers certainly don’t think of themselves as a Left-Handed Legacy, they do recognize that openly advertising their methods would be unwise. Therefore, the members tend to cleave close to their tutors but seldom see other Elect. If several happen to operate in the same area, they often hash out some sort of schedule so that all of them aren’t knocking people’s souls off-kilter at the same time, as such a thing would quickly draw notice from other mages.<div>The tutor-pupil relationship in the Echo Walkers is very close, largely because the members don’t expect anyone else to understand them the way another Echo Walker can. The Legacy mimics a cult or a radical church in this respect. The Echo Walkers don’t necessarily look down on other mages for not recognizing the Ones Before, but the Elect do see talking to such Awakened about magical matters as tedious and frustrating, because outsiders lack the “correct” frame of reference. There is no set proscription, though, that prevents Echo Walkers from joining orders or cabals. Thus, one of the Elect might be a high-ranking member of a Consilium without anyone except her tutor knowing it.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>To hear the Echo Walkers tell it, their Legacy began the moment the Ones Before were barred from interacting with humans by the gulf of the Abyss. There have always been mages on the Path of the Mighty, they say, who strive to bring the angels to the world — or, barring that, become those angels, to the extent that they can.</div><div>In fact, though, the Legacy’s first known practitioner dates back to the mid-17th century, as the Puritans were crossing the Atlantic for religious freedom. One of those Puritans, a man that history remembers as Adam Goode, Awakened during the crossing. His account, written on fragments of paper and reassembled in later years, describes a conversation with the angels of the Aether and his subsequent “realization” of their true nature:</div><div><i>I came upon a great tower, so high that I could not see the top, so bright that it nearly blinded me. I drew in my breath and allowed the light of the Lord to fill me, and it lifted me up, and in a blink of an eye I stood upon the top of the Tower. And all about me were luminous angels. Some were winged and some carried swords, but some resembled great beasts, and still I knew them all as angels. And one said unto me, “Behold, Adam Goode, for you have been chosen to look out upon the Kingdom of Celestial Spheres and know the world for what it is — Fallen.”</i></div><div><i>And I said unto the angel, “Have mercy upon me, for I am but man, consigned to the watery depths by the will of the Almighty,” for I believed myself to have been flung into the sea by the storm. And the angel said, “No, Adam Goode, you have not perished, but are exalted, and stand here upon the Watchtower of the Golden Key to meet your destiny as one of the Mighty.” And I knew then of the nature of the beings around me — not the angelic Host, but their children, scoured from the Earth in the Great Flood. I had been chosen to walk among them, to become one of the Mighty, and I knew that these beings were from Before. My voice died in my throat, but I made my mark in their great book, and before I could ask further questions or utter my thanks I was back on the ship, and all around me was thunder, lashing rain and fear. And I pointed to the sky and commanded the storm to cease, and as I was one of the Mighty, it did obey.”</i></div><div>Adam Goode reached America, but by that time most of his fellow Puritans were dead or mad. Plague on such ships, of course, wasn’t uncommon, but when these new settlers came ashore they told strange tales to the resident colonists. The newcomers spoke of Adam’s sermons and the way he would lay his hand upon their foreheads, his fingers colder than death and yet searing at the same time. Many of those who had received “Adam’s Touch” died in their sleep or jumped into the sea within a month or two, and even those who survived were haunted by terrible nightmares, malaise, paranoia and general ill health for the rest of their lives. Adam, for his part, opined that his touch was merely opening the recipient’s soul to the glory of the Ones Before, and that Satan was attracted to those thus illuminated and caused their afflictions. This flimsy logic only held up for so long (particularly as mages among both the colonists and the native peoples saw the detrimental effects of Adam’s magic), and Adam Goode was hanged in 1687 for witchcraft. He was suspected to have taken on apprentices, however, but they were never identified. The Echo Walker Legacy, then called the Covenant of the First Angels, had taken root.</div><div>Over the ensuing centuries, the Legacy spread out across the United States, and then the world. Many cultures and mythologies have stories about some primal race, sometimes sublime, sometimes bestial, and these tales were easily subsumed into the Legacy’s beliefs. As the Legacy grew and encompassed other theories on the Ones Before, the Covenant of the First Angels became the Walkers in the Echoes of the First Voices, and later simply the Echo Walkers.</div><div>The Elect have adapted their theories with the times, and this is part of what makes them so dangerous — it’s not accurate to classify them as religious fanatics, because some Echo Walkers are quite secular. It’s not accurate to say that they believe in the Nephilim, or the Titans or any other mythological precursor to humans, because some Echo Walkers don’t believe any such thing. And, while it is accurate to call them a Left-Handed Legacy, doing so is dangerous. Most mages think of the Scelesti or perhaps the Tremere liches when that term is applied, and such mages are often easy to identify with close scrutiny. But the Echo Walkers can be part of a Consilium or even a cabal for years before the nature of their magic becomes apparent.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>To the Echo Walkers, the human soul is a kind of living record. The human soul is a lens with which a perceptive mage can view the original “blueprint” of humanity — the Ones Before. Of course, motives for wishing to view this blueprint vary, as do the ultimate goals of the Echo Walkers, but the treatment of the soul in question is uniformly unpleasant. The Death 2/Prime 1 “Dislodge the Soul” spell (see sidebar) is an integral part of the Legacy, and learning the Glimpse of Glory rote based upon it is often part of the induction into the Echo Walkers.</div><div>Other mages, however, don’t normally know enough about the Echo Walkers to recognize them as a threat. These so-called Elect seem to be driven, zealous and perhaps a bit deluded, but ultimately their fanaticism is aimed at the Supernal Realms, not at serving the Abyss, stealing immortality or some other unpalatable prospect. Yes, individual Echo Walkers might be dangerous, but that danger is a function of their zeal, not their beliefs per se.</div><div>Those Awakened who know that the Echo Walkers not only seek to learn about the Ones Before, but do so by forcing Sleepers’ souls out of alignment and peering into the gap between soul and consciousness, see the Legacy in the same light that most mages see the Wicked or the liches. The Echo Walkers are taught that they will, at some point, probably run into a mage who knows of the more unpleasant aspects of their quest. When confronted, the Echo Walkers are taught to make the magic seem, if not benign, then at least reversible. For whatever it’s worth, a few Echo Walkers do learn the required Spirit magic to repair the damage done by their spells and make it a point to do so. Others use more mundane means of helping their victims, such as sponsoring free clinics to help people suffering from depression. These altruistic behaviors only last until the mage’s Wisdom falls to the point that she simply doesn’t care anymore. The Echo Walkers know, though, that most Consilii will not appreciate what the Elect are trying to accomplish, and the members of the Legacy are advised to have an escape plan ready.</div><div>Searching for the Ones Before Every Echo Walker has her own reasons for trying to find the truth about the angels of the Aether. Some of the Elect feel that the Ones Before have knowledge that would allow the Abyss to finally close and for mages to reveal themselves to a world that can finally understand them. Mages of a more religious bent might believe that living service to or emulation of the Ones Before is akin to a holy vow, but before the Echo Walkers can actually take this vow, they must learn what it entails.</div><div>Some Echo Walkers are in it for the sheer philosophical discovery — what are these Supernal beings, and how do they fit into humanity’s destiny? Other Elect are simply power-hungry, and see the Ones Before as a source of potentially limitless magical prowess if the Echo Walkers can learn their secrets. Finally, some Elect theorize that the Ones Before might not be a more enlightened state of humanity, but instead might represent a less advanced version. If that is the case, then what did humanity gain by giving up the obvious glory and power of the Ones Before?</div><div>Many of these reasons are benign or even noble, or at least understandable, when the mage begins her journey. As Wisdom falls, though, the mage’s quest tends to become obsessed with an image of the Ones Before. Her reasons for searching for them fall away, slowly but surely, replaced by a simplistic need to know about them. At this point, usually around Wisdom 4 or 5, the mage develops the Image of Perfection Merit (see sidebar). The mage has abandoned so much of her humanity that she would betray her order, cabal and even her closest friends and family if it meant learning even one tiny iota of information about the Ones Before.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>New Merit: Image of Perfection (•••)</h4><div><b>Prerequisite:</b> Echo Walker, Death 2</div><div>Effect: The Echo Walker has developed a goal for herself, an image of her own soul merged with the glory and might of the Ones Before. This image is her muse, her daimon and her constant guide, beckoning her on through any moments of doubt or uncertainty. She becomes unable to consider that any action taken in pursuit of this goal is immoral or harmful, no matter how others might be affected. Such Echo Walkers often have constructed reasons or excuses as to why this is the case, usually with some variation on the “greater good” or the “ends justifying the means.” What it boils down to, however, is that the mage’s lust for power outweighs her morality.</div><div>This doesn’t prevent the mage from losing Wisdom, of course, but does help in avoiding the insanity that comes with Wisdom loss. After gaining this Merit, whenever the Echo Walker loses a dot of Wisdom due to an act of Hubris, the player can spend a Willpower point to change the dice pool to avoid gaining a derangement to the character’s Resolve + Composure rather than her new Wisdom rating. The character’s Image of Perfection keeps her focused and, if not exactly sane, than at least functional. This serves to make Echo Walkers very dangerous, however, as they become true sociopaths given enough time.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Echo Walkers who wish to act as tutors to potential members have a delicate time ahead. A few Obrimos emerge from their Awakenings wanting to know the truth about the angels of Aether, but few are willing to base their magical practice on seeking out these beings, particularly if doing so means causing harm to others. Some Echo Walkers get around this by finding potential pupils before they Awaken, but there is no guarantee that a prospective mage will indeed Awaken at the Watchtower of the Golden Key, or find her way back from the Supernal Realms at all.</div><div>Tutors, therefore, spend a great deal of time feeling out prospective students before making any offers. The tutors take special interest in the Obrimos’ experiences during her Awakening. After all, not every mage even visits the Supernal Realms in a direct fashion, and Obrimos who experienced mystery plays instead of “normal” Awakenings (see p. 31 of Mage: The Awakening) aren’t usually the kind of mage that the Elect invite aboard. If nothing else, an Echo Walker often tries to teach the prospective member the rudiments of the Death Arcana, since it is not only necessary for the Legacy’s research but tends to be difficult for Obrimos to learn.</div><div>If a tutor successfully captures a student’s interest in the Ones Before (by whatever name the student is comfortable using), the tutor slowly shows his student the “evidence” that the Legacy has collected on these beings. What form this evidence takes depends on the mage in question. Some have books of accounts, drawings and other primary sources about these figures, others use the Prime Arcanum to create illusions of them. At every turn, the tutor stresses that the Legacy doesn’t know enough about the Ones Before to make a definitive judgment about their nature or on the concrete benefit of unlocking their secrets. One might expect this admission of ignorance to turn prospective members away, but mages are generally curious and often a little arrogant. Where other Awakened have failed, perhaps this new pupil might succeed? How much glory would an Obrimos who uncovered the secrets of the angels of the Aether receive?</div><div>Adding credence to the tutor’s words is the fact that he truly believes what he is saying. The Echo Walkers don’t have a sinister agenda (it’s their methods that are sinister), and so even the most paranoid mage won’t find traps or lies waiting for her in the Legacy. The Echo Walkers promise the potential of glory, knowledge and power, and they mean to deliver exactly that.</div><div>The First Step When an Obrimos agrees to join the Echo Walkers, the first thing she must be taught is the Glimpse of Glory rote (see above). This, of course, often requires making her an Apprentice of Death, since the Death Arcanum is difficult for the Theurgists to learn. Many nascent Elect wonder if perhaps there might be a better way to go about learning about the Ones Before. The Echo Walkers are happy to try any method that a pupil can think of, but the fact is that Death is the only Arcanum suitable for manipulating the human soul. Time can’t reach far enough back to glimpse the world before the Fall, and Spirit can’t take a mage back to the Aether. The Echo Walkers lament that studying Death is the only way to reach their goal, but so be it.</div><div>Once the pupil has learned this rote (by which time she has normally practiced it enough for her Wisdom rating to drop a bit), the tutor begins teaching her the Life Arcanum in preparation for the first Attainment. During this time, the pupil is expected to refrain from conducting “research” into the Ones Before (that is, dislodging souls) without the tutor’s presence. This is partially to avoid notice from other mages, but mostly because the Echo Walkers don’t want someone who is not a member of their Legacy to gain insight into the Ones Before that they don’t possess.</div><div>Once the mage has made enough progress in her magical studies (which is a matter for the tutor to decide), the tutor and the pupil begin the soul-forging process. Joining the Echo Walkers shows the mage what Sleepers feel when their souls are dislodged, as the tutor uses the Death 4 variant of the “Dislodge the Soul” spell on the pupil in order to begin the process (mechanically, this spell is identical to Dislodge the Soul, though the pupil submits willingly). Of course, when the process is complete, the mage is whole again, and therefore any sympathy with Sleepers doesn’t tend to last.</div><div>The Second Step Some mages leave their tutors after achieving the first Attainment, having learned firsthand what their Sleeper victims go through. These mages are still Echo Walkers, but refuse to progress any further in the Legacy because doing so involves harming others. These laudable mages are tolerated so long as they keep quiet about the Legacy’s methods — which, of course, few of them do. Destroying their pupils pains the Echo Walkers, but they feel that doing so is preferable to having the Awakened community as a whole lump the Elect in with the Scelesti, the liches and their Left-Handed ilk.</div><div>Mages who stay with their tutors are encouraged to gather as much data as they can. What follows is a spree of soul dislodging that usually leaves the mage with a precipitous drop in Wisdom, along with a number of dead or mad Sleepers in her wake. Many Echo Walkers believe that they gain better results when using the “Dislodge the Soul” spell on a certain type of Sleeper, but this is simply a way for the mage to subconsciously feel better about the harm she is inflicting. A racist white mage might decide that she can see the Ones Before more clearly when looking through the souls of African Americans (and, in the process, believe that she’s not racist at all, since she recognizes that black people clearly have a strong connection to the Ones Before). Any bias or prejudice can appear here, and Echo Walkers often developed elaborate theories as to why a given type of person produces a clearer picture.</div><div>Once the mage has accumulated a good body of data on the Ones Before, she presents her findings to her tutor. This presentation can take the form of a thesis, a lecture or any other medium that the tutor finds appropriate. If the pupil’s presentation meets the tutor’s approval, he declares her worthy of progressing in the Legacy and the pupil reshapes her soul once again.</div><div>The Third Step Few Echo Walkers reach the third Attainment, but it’s not for lack of trying. Once the mage has presented her findings on the Ones Before to her tutor (and thus achieved the second Attainment), she has become one of the Legacy’s up-and-coming researchers. She is then expected to be extremely selective in her choices of Sleepers to “study,” choosing only those who have something to contribute. How this is determined, of course, depends very much on that mage’s research. Normally, the mage examines a prospective Sleeper carefully, often using such spells as Death 1 “Soul Marks,” for whatever trait she finds important, before dislodging the Sleeper’s soul.</div><div>Since the mage is establishing a pattern, though, she is also making it easier for others to track her. Upon reaching the second Attainment, Echo Walkers are warned that if they are captured or questioned, they must not betray the Legacy, lest all of the research of the Elect be lost. Echo Walkers, therefore, often fight to the death if confronted, though more clever ones make use of spells such as Mind 2 “Memory Hole.”</div><div>Most Echo Walkers develop the Image of Perfection Merit (see p. 125) during this period, fixating on their ideal picture of the Ones Before. If an Echo Walker manages to build up a convincing picture and theory of what these beings truly are before she becomes irrevocably insane or is hunted down by other mages, her tutor allows her to make her presentation to a council composed of three Echo Walkers who have achieved the third Attainment. This presentation takes the form of an interview or thesis defense, with the more advanced members grilling the pupil on her theory, its applications and any supporting evidence. A Sleeper is almost always presented as part of this evidence. The elder Echo Walkers dislodge the unfortunate’s soul and examine the “data,” usually with someone on hand who can reattach the soul so as to facilitate repeated viewings. (This punishment is very often fatal for the Sleeper, but the mages present have typically long since passed the point of concern.)</div><div>The actual merit of the data presented at this council is probably negligible. The mages have become so blind, and usually mad, by this point that their delusions simply feed into one another. However, an Echo Walker who can remain functional long enough to reach this point is rewarded with the third Attainment. After that, she continues her research, normally picking up a pupil of her own not long after.</div><div>Note, of course, that an Echo Walker can actually achieve the third Attainment on her own without submitting to the examinations of the council. The pupil isn’t told this piece of information, however. If she figures it out on her own, the more learned members of the Legacy congratulate her on her ingenuity — and keep very close tabs on this most clever of the Elect from then on.</div>",

The Elect’s own frail bodies cannot approach this sort of glory, but with the second Attainment of this Legacy, the Echo Walkers can at least start down the right path. Similar to the Life 3 “Honing the Form” spell, the Form of the Nephilim Attainment allows the mage to increase her Physical Attributes. Sadly, this increase is temporary. The meat of the Fallen World does not hold on to the power of the Supernal easily, not with the Abyss constantly sucking the power away.</div><div>To activate this Attainment, the mage merely concentrates for a few seconds and wills her body to take on the strength and nobility of her spiritual forerunners. The player spends one point of Mana. She can then add a number of dots equal to the character’s Life Arcanum into one of the mage’s Physical Attributes. This allocation can be different each time the Attainment is used. For instance, a mage with Life 3 might choose to add the points to Strength if she is anticipating a fistfight. If she needs fine motor control or precise handling of an object, she might instead allocate them to Dexterity.</div><div>This Attainment can boost Attributes over the maximum normally allowed by the character’s Gnosis. Any increases to these Attributes also affect derived traits such as Speed and Health (see “Temporary Health Dots” on p. 173 of the World of Darkness Rulebook).</div><div>Echo Walkers often become more attractive when using this Attainment.

        "secondAttainmentOptDescrizione": "<div>While the physical prowess that this Attainment brings is often a good enough reason for using it, the Echo Walkers sometimes need to demonstrate their power and enlightenment to doubting mages (or even to Sleepers). If the mage also knows Prime 3, she can create a magical halo around her, and even add wings, weapons or any other features she believes that the Ones Before might have possessed. This effect is similar to the Prime 3 “Phantasm” spell, save that the illusion is centered around the mage herself and does not cost Mana. The illusion can make the Echo Walker look either angelically beautiful or horrifically ugly, but cannot make her appear nondescript or be used to disguise her. Calling upon the Form of the Nephilim in this manner is meant to awe or terrify her audience.</div><div>Aside from any bonuses to Intimidation or Persuasion rolls that this use of the Attainment might grant, calling upon the illusion also changes the Echo Walker’s personal resonance somewhat. Her own aura and nimbus are obscured for as long as the illusion lasts, replaced with the feeling of unmitigated glory of the Ones Before.</div>",

        "thirdAttainmentDescription": "<div>Deep within the hearts and souls of all Sleepers — indeed, all human beings — is the compulsion to follow and obey the Ones Before. This, in many legends, is what forced these elder beings into exile or called down their destruction from their enemies or creator, but the Echo Walkers feel that since humans are predisposed toward certain instinctual reactions, there is no harm in making use of them. By triggering deepseated biological programming, the Echo Walkers can nudge others to take certain actions.</div><div>This Attainment works similarly to the Life 4 “Trigger the Lizard Brain” spell (see p. 191 of Mage: The Awakening), but affords the mage a slightly greater range of responses she can evoke. The player rolls Presence + Medicine + Life in a contested roll against the target’s Resolve + Gnosis. If the Echo Walker wins, she may evoke any instinctual response that the target is capable of — mindless rage, abject fear, the urge to mate and so on. Because the part of the brain being triggered is so closely linked with memory and learning, however, the mage may choose to manipulate the target’s mind more subtly. This changes the roll to Manipulation + Medicine + Life (still contested in the same way). If the roll is successful, the target is unable to process any new memories for the duration of the scene. His brain simply does not convert the information from short-term to long-term memory. This means that no matter what the Echo Walker does to the target during the next hour or so, he won’t remember it, and no magic based on retrieving the memory allows him to (since it simply isn’t present in his brain). Magic or supernatural powers based on psychometry or postcognition, of course, reveal what happened in that area and thus can show a viewer what the Echo Walker did or learned.</div><div>Obviously, use of this Attainment can very easily require a degeneration roll, depending on what use the mage puts the Attainment.</div>",

With a simple command, they can quash any active spells that offend them, in much the same way as the Prime 4 “Supernal Dispellation” spell (see p. 229 of Mage: The Awakening). This requires the Echo Walker’s player to roll Resolve + Occult + Prime as an instant action, and equal or exceed the Potency of the targeted spell. She does not need to know the Arcana involved in the spell; she must simply recognize that the spell exists."

The Awakened are those who have freed their souls of the chains of Quiescence, enabling themselves to glimpse some of the world’s true secrets. This knowledge is what gives them their power.</div><div>There are other ways to use the power of secrets. To destroy a secret is a final act, one that can never be repaired or repealed. Some mages learn how to eradicate knowledge, ensuring that it can never be recovered. These mages’ souls absorb and consume secrets, dissolving them as an amoeba devours its nutrients, and with the same result. Complete destruction of unshared knowledge, perfect in its privacy, gifts such a mage with strength and power that she could not otherwise possess. This is an unacceptable habit by the standards of most mages.</div><div>Secrets are the lifeblood of Supernal power. Even the smallest secret might be the key that unlocks the next portal into the Mysteries. The words of a long-dead Adamantine Arrow might be the last clue necessary for a contemporary master of Forces to reach archmastery. Secrets might lead members of the Mysterium to a lost temple from the time of Atlantis.</div><div>Knowledge is what mages need, and destroying it is anathema to them. Keeping secrets close, hiding them, parceling them out to only the worthy and righteous, these are all par for the course. But to consume knowledge, losing it forever, is what makes the Logophages — or Secret Keepers, as they call themselves — a Left-Landed Legacy.</div><div>Most important is what binds the members of this Legacy to one another: keeping secrets. All the Logophage does is in the service of keeping the secrets from falling into the wrong hands. There are so many mages in the Fallen World who belong there, who are fallen, too, and would not properly use the knowledge available to them. Sleepers would not understand what they learned even as their attention tarnished it. In order to prevent the misuse of the Arcana, and to prevent the Mysteries from unraveling beneath the Sleepers’ collective gaze, Logophages put secrets where none will ever see them. A mage truly worthy to wield knowledge that a Secret Keeper has hidden will find a way, they believe. They destroy understanding in order to save it, and it is the nobility of their quest that empowers them — not some obscene exchange of truth for might.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Secret Keepers (their own name for themselves), Logophages (other mages’ name for the Legacy)",
        "orders": "All of the orders desire more clues to the Mysteries. Keys to understanding are the blood in their veins and the currency that trades hands. In that light, it’s no surprise that the rumors of this Legacy bring out anger in all of them, the rage that they often can’t direct at the distant Exarchs. When the Logophages come up in discussion, the conversation inevitably turns dark, often murderously so. Pentacle mages consider the Logophages to be doing the next best thing to working for the Exarchs directly. Logophages do as much, some claim, as the Seers of the Throne toward suppressing the world’s magic and mages. But no order is as vocal as the Mysterium. Mystagogues endlessly rummage through the lost corners of the world, and so often their progress depends on the missing word of a riddle or the faded portion of a map. To them, the habits of the Logophages are nothing short of sabotage and treason.<div>Conversely, the Guardians of the Veil are, if not agreeable, more sympathetic with the concept of a Logophage. Few actively want to destroy knowledge not known, but rare is the Guardian who hasn’t felt the simple (and flawed) urge to destroy material rather than hide it. It is safe, if not wise, and some extreme Guardians of the Veil leave behind the “illusion” that they steal and hide secrets not for their power, but for others’ Wisdom. Despite this sympathy, Guardians are aware that more whispers connect the Logophages to their order than others, and occasionally make an effort to root followers of the Legacy out of their ranks.</div>",
        "appearance": "Because Secret Keepers are members of a Left-Handed Legacy, they need to blend in. In general, a Logophage looks just like a mage trying to look like a Sleeper. Some Logophages develop slight tells in their personalities. They eavesdrop and spy almost habitually, though they are relatively subtle about it, because even mundane secrets are secrets to be used.",
        "background": "As noted above, Guardians of the Veil who begin to obsess about keeping dangerous secrets hidden may step over the edge into this Legacy. Such a mage might begin by worrying overmuch about the security of certain knowledge, then develop that concern into a full-blown paranoia by keeping secrets only to himself. Others cannot be trusted to prevent them from falling into unworthy hands. From there, it is only a small advance into the territory of the Logophage — consuming the clues is the only way to keep them forever safe, especially in a world where one’s foes can read one’s mind. The power that results from the Logophage’s meal of secrets is simply the strength of righteousness.<div>This “madness” can come upon any mage, as every member of the Awakened world quickly learns the importance of concealing the truths of the Fallen World from its Sleeping inhabitants. Such knowledge should also be kept from many other mages, because only few deserve that understanding. Some, for example, the Guardians, begin to take the matter too far. It becomes clear to them that there are none worthy, and that they should, therefore, destroy the knowledge, or they delude themselves into thinking that the hiding is more important than measured sharing. They then seek to become, as a Logophage, the best of hiding places.</div>",
        "organizzation": "The ties that bind Logophages to one another are very, very loose but very, very secure. Tutors of this Legacy meet their students the way fanatics of any sort do — by sounding out each others’ ideologies and finding the agreement that they need. The process is careful and exacting, not proof against betrayal but functional enough that the Logophages have survived since ancient times.<div>After a certain amount of instruction, the master and student separate, because their security best lies in distance. This bond and the identity of one’s pupil is the one thing that no Logophage can ever forget, secret though it may be. Occasionally, one will contact the other — they share recent goals reached (but never sought). Sharing what secrets they have successfully protected from danger is impossible, but they can occasionally describe what sort of understanding they have “saved.”</div><div>In rare instances, one knows of a threatening secret that is soon to be uncovered or that is unsecure and in danger of being disseminated beyond one’s ability to consume it. That one might request that a teacher or student recover the secret first and guard it from undesired discovery.</div><div>Beyond the student-teacher bond that the Secret Keepers keep forever, the amount of organized communication between followers of this Legacy borders on none. Each and every Logophage understands that other mages do not recognize the nobility of the Logophages’ efforts. To be too open, or too lax in protecting themselves, would shortly result in the destruction of their already limited brotherhood. In the pursuit of security, a Logophage routinely purges himself of any knowledge of his contacts. This practice helps prevent other Awakened investigators from rifling through the mage’s mind and learning enough to devastate the Legacy’s goals. That burning the knowledge gives the Logophage a small burst of power is merely an attractive by-product; to the Secret Keepers, it is a reward for good duty.</div><div>Not knowing any other Secret Keepers beyond one’s tutor and students has a price. When a Logophage needs trustworthy help, he rarely has more than one or two mages whom he believes can “safely” observe something secret. They may not be available. He needs to depend on mages whom he can manipulate, and he must force them into a situation in which he can control the flow of information. If necessary, he won’t hesitate to tear their memories apart after he no longer needs them. Such acts threaten to endanger the Logophage’s overall mission but are sometimes necessary.</div><div>Two Secret Keepers sometimes meet through happenstance. Each may be sounding out the other as a potential candidate for induction, only to discover that they are already allies in their war to defend the Mysteries. Such meetings are occasionally fortuitous, occurring when one Logophage or the other needs confidential assistance. Most of the time, the two mages simply “forget” about one another (via their first Attainment) as soon as is convenient. The Legacy survives through secrecy.</div>",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>Purportedly, early Secret Keepers decided that the greatest threat to their cause was the possibility that other mages might discover the Secret Keepers’ genesis and learn how to destroy them. So they chose to forget their foundation, protecting it as they do all important secrets. As far as anyone knowing the truth, that was the end of that. Not all Logophages, or other mages, for that matter, are willing to leave it at that.</div><div>The histories that mages can find are too varied to be worth too much. Only a rough estimate of timing pervades all the myths: they all agree that the first Secret Keepers formed during the time of troubles following Atlantis’ Fall. Here are a few beliefs that some Logophages may hold, or that the mages who research them may uncover.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Consequence of Sin</h3><div>The unintentional father of the Legacy, the mage known as Oholibamah, lived in the period following the Fall. In his folly, others found inspiration. A small cabal of Logophages reconstructed the events after the fact. Oholibamah seemed to have been working with a group of other mages while seeking to protect and hide away their lore for an age when civilization might rise again. In the process of concealing the resting place of their Artifacts and grimoires, a petty argument led Oholibamah to kill one of his companions in a rage. Then, fearing justice for his action, he slew the rest of the group to keep his sin a secret.</div><div>This is not unique. People kill out of rage and fear every day. What is remarkable is that Oholibamah refused to lose the knowledge the group had journeyed to hide away. During each murder after the first, which was out of passion, Oholibamah took from his companions’ minds all they knew of the Mysteries. He could not comprehend it all, so he compartmentalized it within his memory.</div><div>When Oholibamah was eventually found, he was half-mad from his own conscience and his fraying compartmentalization. Studying his mind and soul, his saviors found a remarkable interaction between the two; examination revealed the first secrets of the Legacy. Despite his sins, he had endeavored to protect knowledge. Oholibamah’s first “students” executed him to make his unintended success complete, then dedicated themselves to being as excellent secret keepers as Oholibamah had been, through his actions and in his death.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>History That Was Not</h3><div>Living in the cold lands in the north, Munin saw how mages interacted: wary, full of distrust, they rarely became friends and every treaty between their groupings required lengthy politicking. They warred over small slights, eager to use their dangerous spells and tools to claim supremacy and spoils. There was no order, no larger organization that bound mages to each other, nothing to prevent the endless self-attrition and nothing to encourage them to greater things. Despairing, Munin sought a miracle.</div><div>Working a great spell aided by her apprentices and bound demons, the great mage created a false past. She invented an island where mages had once ruled, where they had belonged to orders and worked in concert. To make it an attractive belief, she made it a time of ideal magic, free of Paradoxes and with plentiful Mana. She created enemies, usurping gods of the Supernal Realms, to give mages a shared purpose. And mages across the world remembered something greater. They began to share purpose and fear, and in so doing they discovered their potential for greatness. Munin swore her apprentices to secrecy and went to her grave without telling another soul. The apprentices went on to found the Secret Keepers.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Necessity of Cain</h3><div>There were twin brothers once, both mages, identical in every way but that one walked the Path of the Moros and the other the Acanthus. Together, the two brothers came upon something so horrific that both agreed it could never be shared or seen again. Some modern Logophages name it Abyssal, others a fiendish scheme of the Exarchs or the Oracles’ Achilles heel, but none of them know. Here is why they don’t know. No fools these brothers, they knew that someday, somebody would have the secret out of them. That was unthinkable. Together, they sought a way to kill their knowledge so that it might be safe. Between one brother’s mastery of Death and the other’s insight into Fate, they discovered an answer. So it came to pass that the Moros killed his brother, weeping all the while, in a ritual to slay his own memory. In so doing, he saved the world from his terrible knowledge. Instead of remembering what could devastate the world, he remembered only murdering his brother. He was the first Secret Keeper, and to honor his brother’s memory he passed on the Legacy and the responsibility that comes with it.</div><div>As the legend’s name suggests, some Logophages who believe this origin story consider it the foundation of the Bible’s story of Cain and Abel. Studying History It’s not easy to study history at the source, rather than from books. Pages can be reprinted; the actual places where history happened have withered, weathered hundreds or thousands of years, suffered decay, been torn down and rebuilt. Truth is hard to find amidst all the confusion.</div><div>The task only gets harder when people deliberately destroy written knowledge of the event. And when magic ensures that no one remembers it, there are no witnesses, or people who can write new records to replace those lost. Some societies that wipe out written accounts replace them with their own, or keep some form of the truth encrypted with their personal codes, but the Logophages are far too paranoid to believe that’s a secure option. They are very complete when it comes to hiding something, reducing evidence it ever existed to unidentifiable tatters and then forgetting that they ever hid it.</div><div>So, since mages can’t look at what remains to figure out the Secret Keepers’ histories, the mages look at what’s missing. Patterns surround suppression, and those who hunt what the Logophages hide — their Legacy’s origins or valuable secrets — examine what isn’t there. For instance, when the Winnebago tribe’s trickster cycles explain several natural phenomena and cultural practices but ignore certain others, ones that other Native American myths cover, it is a clue. Perhaps that legend was embedded by a mage as a lesson to later shamans or seekers, and it is gone because a Logophage deemed it dangerous and consumed it. Records from the Tang Dynasty mention several thousand magisterial judgments; the fact that none can be found concerning accusations and punishment of charlatan magicians or Taoist alchemists is strange.</div><div>Secret Keepers work very hard to keep what secrets they deem important. They clear away as much of a trail as possible, altering memories and eliminating records. Even the Logophages admit that it’s impossible to get rid of everything; they can only do as much as possible and hope it’s enough.</div><div>Occasionally, a member of this Legacy becomes obsessed (more so than usual) with concealing a specific secret. That person proceeds to attempt to destroy knowledge in ever-widening circles around the secret, never satisfied with its security; he ends up only drawing more attention to it. Secret Keepers consider this something of a sickness. If they refer to it at all, they call it by the simple term: “mania.”</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>In general, Logophages blend in with their Awakened brethren, participating in their orders’ and Consilii’s activities. While Logophages are not pleased with what they perceive as others’ lax attitude toward sharing secrets only among the worthy, Logophages understand that most mages cannot be as dedicated as they. It is a failing they expect of those outside their Legacy.</div><div>A particularly great number of Secret Keepers belong to the Mysterium and the Guardians of the Veil. The former because mystagogues actively seek out ancient knowledge, and being the inside man on such an expedition is one of the most advantageous positions for a Logophage. Logophages occupy the latter because the Guardians’ goals are most similar to the Logophages’ obsessions. Not only do more Secret Keepers recruit from the Guardians of the Veil (and more successfully), but doing so offers a similar advantage when the Guardians steal secret and powerful knowledge from other sources. When a mage’s companions or acquaintances discover that she is a Secret Keeper, she typically neither flees nor fights unless forced to do either. She explains. All but the most extreme Logophages have very rational reasons for believing that they must protect knowledge the way they do. This attempt is often more effective than mages would expect. Few outside the Legacy really know the Secret Keepers’ true aims, considering them nothing more than thieves and destroyers, and learning a Logophage’s perspective sometimes moves her captors. If other mages still do not see the necessity of her mission, so be it; if they were likely to, they might already be Secret Keepers. Some exposed Logophages continue to proselytize throughout their subsequent capture and interrogation, secure in the belief that no one will learn how to find others of her Legacy from her. Others simply flee to a new area, taking a new name and integrating themselves once again into Awakened society.</div><div>Secret Keepers don’t have much of a social structure internal to the Legacy. They are, as one would suspect, very secretive. Quite on purpose, the only bonds a Logophage retains within the Legacy are with his tutor and his students. Even those, he breaks after he or his students attain the third Attainment. Any meetings with other Secret Keepers, usually arranged through tutors or students, are very important secrets to be kept — and Logophages keep them the best way they know how. They don’t come together often, or for anything less than a piece of knowledge they consider pivotal, but once they go their separate ways the Logophages rarely remember their companions. Or the mission, for that matter.</div><div>Members of the Legacy consider themselves protectors of the Fallen World and the Supernal Realms. They guard, in order of importance, the world from the misuse of magic, the Ars Mysteriorum from the attention of the unworthy, and the safety of their Legacy. As important a job as the Secret Keepers are doing, every one of them joined the Legacy out of personal responsibility to the world; they would be remiss to place themselves above their duty.</div><div>Some have trouble believing that they have the wisdom necessary to destroy knowledge: if they are not worthy enough to master a Mystery, how can they be worthy enough to destroy that Mystery? Logophages who suffer this uncertainty may restrict themselves to eliminating secrets of lesser import (but also lesser danger) until they grow more confident (and hubristic, other mages would say). Another Secret Keeper might correspond with her tutor, using her teacher’s wisdom as a guideline until she feels capable of doing it herself.</div><div>Less rarely than Logophages would like, one of their number goes “rogue.” Similar to those afflicted with the mania, these renegades are dangerous and must be stopped. But instead of growing obsessed over the Legacy’s core mission, a rogue Secret Keeper has become disaffected. He sees through the lies they tell themselves — that what they do is for the good of the Awakened, that the information will one day be recovered — and doesn’t care. Enjoying the taste of knowledge and the feeling of power that burning it produces, the rogue acts as a Logophage for his own benefit. Other members of the Legacy hunt down rogues with great prejudice — although Logophages often have as much trouble tracking the rogues as other mages do.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Logophages are very, very cautious about whom they let into their little club. The Secret Keepers must be wary of those mages who do not understand the Legacy’s dedication, and would destroy them. Even beyond that, allowing mages without the ideal moral character and devotion to serve such a grand cause would be folly; should the weak join them and then falter, it could begin a domino effect that would decimate their frail teacher-student networks, perhaps completely dooming their self-appointed mission.</div><div>As noted earlier, a Logophage finds potential pupils by sounding them out on the subject of protecting the Mysteries from Sleepers and unworthy mages. Few potential pupils possess the temperament and principles necessary to “pass,” and those who do must be shaped before they can become true Secret Keepers.</div><div>The tutor, having found a prospective recipient for his Legacy, must now test her. Between philosophical discussions on the nature of the Mysteries and their misapplication, the Logophage arranges for the student to encounter examples of magic misused. If he can show her a demonstration (not his own, surely) of a terrible Paradox or a spell that has harmed the secrecy of the Invisible World, that is ideal. Anything that makes her more concerned about into whose hands the Mysteries fall is a good lesson. When the master can arrange it, the lessons increase in severity and preventability. Pointing directly at a recently discovered secret as the cause of a disaster is about as perfect an example as the mentor could want.</div><div>Once the Secret Keeper decides the student is ready, he begins the test. He gives his student a secret, one both know is worth keeping. It is not, of course, of paramount importance, but it is nothing that should just be thrown away, either. The student receives the knowledge in some form that requires a personal sacrifice for her to protect the secret through destruction. One master might circle certain letters on certain pages of a student’s heirloom book, another might tattoo clues on the student’s back. Something must threaten to expose the knowledge to complete the test. Sometimes this happens naturally, as others ask to borrow the book or the student takes a lover who might see her back; if not, the tutor arranges it — spreading rumors about so-and-so’s hidden magic generally does the trick.</div><div>There is only one real way to pass the test. Knowing that, a Secret Keeper chooses his methods based on his personal belief of how difficult the test should be. It’s one thing to shed a tear and burn the Torah your grandfather used at his bar mitzvah; it’s something else to take a power sander to your own back because anyone who helped you would see the writing. Because of the danger of being a Logophage, more masters of the Legacy tend toward more severe tests of devotion. Unusual scarring or wounds are not uncommon among Secret Keepers, though hardly a tell. Passing this test makes the mage a Proselyte. Logophages rarely use the term in this context, since they speak with other Secret Keepers almost not at all, but they use the title enough with their apprentices to pass it on. Proselyte refers to any inductee to the Legacy, from one who is trusted but without enough Gnosis for the first Attainment to one who has not yet achieved the second Attainment.</div><div>Realizing the Legacy’s first Attainment requires the student to use it. This is not paradoxical, but more sacrifice. As the dedicated pupil feels the shape her soul is taking, it is still not fully formed. Her first step on the road of the Secret Keeper (or down the cursed path of the Logophage, some might say) is to consume one her own secret memories. It must be something powerful, something she loves. The memory of a very personal joy is perfect, but a person may love her hate or misery; forgetting the moment that caused her to swear an unexpressed revenge or the unshared childhood event that drove the rest of her life is just as valid. She is dropping her baggage so that she may advance along her chosen path. This act, the student vandalizing her own memory and shaking the seat of her current personality, locks her into the Legacy in one soul-stirring moment.</div><div>A character may be so very open and expressive that she has no truly secret memories. Such a character probably does not understand keeping things hidden from others well enough to have advanced to the status of Proselyte.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Advancement</h3><div>Once a student possesses the Legacy’s first Attainment, the tutor and pupil typically go separate ways. One, usually the student (as the tutor is a higher-ranked Secret Keeper), may leave for another Consilium, often one a goodly distance away. Most ask other members of their order or Path for the Awakened equivalent of a letter of recommendation — at least a contact in the new area, since it’s very hard to become trusted as an unknown mage. Those who are more confident in their ability to dissemble, or just like taking risks, may play themselves off as new mages and hope to be recruited into an order. Passing induction into whatever order already recruited them once isn’t that hard — for a skilled liar, anyway.</div><div>Some Logophages resist their students’ inclinations to sever the tutor-pupil link to develop the later Attainments on their own. The Legacy, they claim, has already benefited from centuries of development in that vein; already optimal for the Secret Keepers’ purpose and concealment, to change it is dangerous. And the tithe of power doesn’t hurt. Others consider the possibility that a student might be discovered and forced to give up the identity of the only Logophages he cannot forget his tutor  and pupils — a frightening weakness. These teachers encourage their apprentices to strike out on their own, believing improved safety worth the price of an imperfectly shaped soul.</div><div>For those who keep the bond in place, the teacher and pupil meet occasionally. They communicate securely if possible, but not with such heavy security that onlookers would attribute it to anything more than reasonable (for a mage) paranoia. Essentially, they appear to be old friends who occasionally get together for chats. They chat, however, about the form of a soul and how to perfectly eliminate knowledge, instead of local political gaffes and the weather.</div><div>Reaching the second Attainment requires further commitment, another sacrifice. Where releasing one’s past makes the apprentice free to step forward, the next step requires her to clear the path ahead. In order to advance, the student must feed one of her secret ambitions or desires to her soul’s fire. The only goals not valid for this sacrifice are those of the Secret Keepers. Anything else, from the untold desire to become Hierarch or the burning need to kill a mage who slighted her, is an effective choice. Clearing the knowledge from her mind, the mage removes one urge that could tempt her from the path of righteous defense of the Mysteries. From this point on, the mage graduates from Proselyte to Secret Keeper. Others who recognize the character’s level of advancement generally accord her respect for being a full member of the Legacy, though a little disdain or distrust for those younger or less advanced is not unusual.</div><div>When the pupil is ready for the third Attainment, to become a pupil no more, the act of forgetting who once taught her lets her attain it. Her teacher’s tutelage helps her reach the position of understanding from where she can take that step, but once she does, she does not know him any longer. Everything she once knew about the person who guided her is gone, and she is a master Logophage in her own right. Logophages who diverge from the core Legacy may develop separate sacrifices, or other actions necessary for advancement within the Legacy.</div>",

        "attainmentsDescrizione": "The Attainments of the Secret Keepers allow the Legacy’s dedicated members to destroy knowledge as effectively as possible. Books may be burnt, computer records destroyed and ancient Artifacts buried under the ocean, but human knowledge is hard to fully annihilate.

        "firstAttainmentDescription": "<div>This Attainment is the mainstay of the Secret Keepers’ Legacy. While many mages understand how to submerge some of their knowledge for a short time, the Logophage perfects that art. More than simply concealing knowledge, the Logophage can wipe it completely from his mind. His mind consumes the memory so well he can never recall it. Logophages consider this to be the power they receive for their dedication; to them, they are not destroying knowledge, but returning it to the Supernal (or some other place they imagine to be safe) until one worthy of that wisdom will retrieve or rediscover it.</div><div>Secret Keepers also know that consuming information for its own sake is not always the wisest course of action. A Logophage may be forced to retain certain knowledge until he can be sure that evidence of its existence has been removed. For this reason, they also learn how to conceal secrets without destroying them. Security of the Lost functions identically to the Mind 2 “Memory Hole” spell. Per the spell’s description, each success on a Resolve + Occult + Mind roll subtracts one die from others’ dice pools to detect lies relevant to the concealed subject.</div><div>Using this Attainment to consume knowledge is an unrolled instant action; it immediately destroys all knowledge of the secret the mage has. Doing so might give him one or more points of Willpower, depending on the secret’s potency.</div><div>The Logophage keeps these points of Willpower in a special “Logophage pool.” There is no limit to the number of Willpower points a Logophage may keep in this pool. They do not represent dots of a trait; they are not lost when an effect drains Willpower, and they don’t protect him against deleterious effects that occur when his true Willpower pool is empty.</div><div>Otherwise, he can spend these points in place of Willpower, though still only one point per turn from either pool. Logophages use this as the final act of consuming knowledge. Prior to using this power, they destroy or censor any other sources of the information. They often wipe out many of the clues that would lead to it. People who know the information must be dealt with, either through murder, long-term conditioning, incurred amnesia or the Legacy’s third Attainment.</div><div>If the secret belongs to somebody in particular (especially if the third Attainment is involved), that target can only be affected once per chapter.</div>",

        "secondAttainmentDescription": "Secret Keepers cannot protect what they do not know. While Logophages study to improve their ability to find and recognize potent information without talking to others, they cannot know everything. This Attainment makes a Logophage able to recognize what he reads or perceives no matter what; the Mind 3 “Universal Language” spell is effectively active for the mage at all times. Should she desire, she can suppress it for a time. Logophages use this to read ciphers that might conceal the existence of a valuable secret, or to interpret telepathic messages that they manage to tap into.",

        "secondAttainmentOptDescrizione": "Mages who also have Fate 3 gain the ability to recognize important secrets by the way they shake the web of destiny.

They can burn books, wipe hard drives and deface ancient enlightenment as much as they like, but doing so won’t help as long as there are still others who know what the Secret Keeper wants to forget. This is one of the powers that makes other mages hate the Logophages so: they can permanently remove knowledge from their victims. Similar to the Mind 4 “Breach the Vault of Memory” spell, a member of the Legacy may invoke this spell with a dice pool of Resolve + Occult + Mind versus Resolve + Gnosis. Success removes knowledge of the offending secret, or relevant clues toward the secret, with a default duration of one day.<div>During that period, the Logophage’s victim does not count as having that knowledge for the purpose of Security of the Lost. Should the Secret Keeper successfully activate his first Attainment while subjecting a mage (or many mages) to this power, the effect becomes permanent.</div>",

        "descrizione": "<div>Human history records countless individuals who could alter the fates of nations and the hearts of kings with their words. Great orators like Pericles of Athens made speeches that touched the depths of their listeners’ hearts and spirits. However, not all amazing orators were great political leaders; some were inveterate con artists like Cagliostro, or figures of mystery such as the Comte St. Germain. The ability to lie convincingly and to convince others that the speaker is both truthful and worth listening to is not uncommon among Sleepers; truly great orators, however, who can convince people to change long-held opinions or cause those they speak with to trust their own senses less than the speaker’s works are rare indeed.</div><div>For many, the attainment of such verbal excellence is too difficult and subtle a path to power. Most people find the more obvious language of violence, threats and bribes to be easier, as well as exceedingly powerful and effective. However, even the most dire threat or the most tempting bribe only serves to control the subject’s actions — in their hearts, they still know and understand that they are being coerced and may someday learn to resist fear or temptation and disobey the person offering the threats or bribes.</div><div>Threats of disobedience soon start a vicious cycle, in which the individual who wishes to remain in charge must continually offer ever more extravagant threats or bribes, or sometimes both together, to make certain that their subjects continue to obey them. Realizing the difficulty and the ultimate futility of such endeavors, some would-be rulers seek to find ways to convince their subjects to follow them willingly and to accept the ruler’s pronouncements as the ultimate truth. Long ago, Machiavelli said that it is better to be feared than loved, because love is more ephemeral, but wise rulers, as well as skilled con artists, advertising agents and some mages understand that being trusted and believed is best of all.</div><div>Whether Sleeper or mage, the path to gaining a listener’s trust is similar – the speaker must understand the secret language hidden in every person’s unconscious. This language of pupil dilation, posture, stance, vocal tone and many similar cues is exceedingly subtle and difficult to master, but the rewards are correspondingly great. While mortals who master these methods can become great orators and equally impressively liars, mages who pursue this Legacy can become greater still. Legends speak of a Bearer of the Eternal Voice being found at a murder scene clutching a bloody knife in his hand, but who was released solely based upon his account of the events leading up to his discovery with the knife.</div><div>In the ancient streets of Atlantis, the Bearers of the Eternal Voice walked among the populace, reassuring them about the wisdom of their rulers and convincing them of the urgent necessity of opposing the enemies of Atlantis. In this longlost era, the Bearers of the Eternal Voice also went in secret to other nations, convincing both leaders and important members of the populace of the folly of opposing Atlantis and of the great benefits that would swiftly follow an alliance with this great power.</div><div>Since the Fall, those who study this Legacy are often called Whisperers, because of the hidden and secretive role they must now play. However, the necessity of secrecy has in no way lessened their powers. In the millennia since the Fall, Whisperers have found additional uses for their talents. The most important are being able to reduce Sleepers’ Disbelief and halting the spread of knowledge of magic.</div><div>There are far too few Whisperers to talk to every Sleeper who has ever seen evidence of magic, much less the many thousands who have merely heard of such acts. However, Whisperers do their best to convince Sleepers that the most obvious damaging evidence for vulgar magic has some completely natural and reasonable explanation. Because Whisperers’ abilities can also be used against other mages, especially mages less skilled in the Mind Arcanum, Whisperers are a somewhat secretive and insular group. This tendency is further exacerbated by the fact that their ability to manipulate others gives many Whisperers, particularly those who follow the Mastigos Path, a sense that everyone else is nothing more than will-less pawns whom Whisperers can manipulate as they will. This sense of superiority influences many Whisperers’ dealings with Sleepers and sometimes carries over to their dealings with other mages. This same feeling also produces the intrinsic paradox that all Bearers of the Eternal Voice must find some way to come to terms with. Their Legacy is an intensely social one and to use it they must interact with Sleepers, often with large groups of Sleepers. However, Whisperers are also keenly aware they are manipulating the people they talk to, and some Whisperers regularly manipulate their fellow mages. While many Whisperers genuinely like people and simply have no problem lying to individuals they like, most are highly social misanthropes who do not particularly care for or about others.</div><div>While some Legacies are declining in favor as the 21st century marches on, the Whisperers are growing more popular — the growing prevalence of advertising, political spin, online con games and the increasing number of mages who realize the power of the ability to manipulate communication and belief all combine to cause mages to flock to their ranks.</div>",

Since there is also power in status and conformity, the business suit is the unofficial uniform of the Whisperers.

However, unless circumstances dictate otherwise, a Whisperer is usually found in a suit.",

Many come from families in which one or both parents worked as con artists, advertising agents or in other professions in which the truth was considered to be highly flexible. Although in the past, Whisperers traditionally came from either the highest or the lowest classes, today Whisperers come from every social class and income bracket.",
        "background": "There is no real hierarchy beyond the basic bond of tutor and student for many Bearers of the Eternal Voice, especially for Mastigos who have no association with the Guardians of the Veil. Because some con games and similar deceptions require more than one participant, most independent tutors require their students to periodically help them pull a con. Similarly, students who need another participant can either call upon their tutors and give them a substantial cut of any profits for their trouble, or seek out another of the loose association of Whisperers. In contrast, Whisperers who also belong to the Guardians of the Veil are part of a tightly knit organization. These Whisperers are typically deeply enmeshed in the intricacies of the Labyrinth and are often important members of one or more of the central groups. Few Whisperers are willing to take sufficient time away from their magical studies to actually run any of the many groups involved in the Labyrinth. However, a surprising number of the important guest speakers and other major peripheral figures involved in everything from UFO cults to organizations of professional skeptics are skilled Whisperers. The most skilled and powerful Whisperers are exceedingly important figures in the hierarchy of the Guardians of the Veil, and their actions regularly causes large numbers of Sleepers to ignore incidents that might otherwise becomes serious problems for the Guardians.",

        "descrizione": "<div>A 19th-century Mysterium philosopher, Lucy Caspian, coined the phrase “the Eleventh Question.” She believed that, at their cores, each of the 10 Arcana supplied the answer to a single question. Space provided the answer to questions of location. Matter could determine or shape the composition of a material object. However, she knew that even the Arcana had their limits. Therefore, an Eleventh Question could provide answers beyond the scope of magic.</div><div>Caspian’s cabal attempted to banish a ghost from its residence so that they could use the country manor as a new home. Incensed, and possessing a will and powers beyond most restless spirits, the ghost inhabited the bodies of each of the cabal in turn, using their mortal shells to murder another member of the cabal. The ghost then used the wizards’ own magic to complicate the murder scenes, making them impossible to solve, even by advanced magic. A reclusive Guardian of the Veil known only as “Sullivan” emerged from his hermitage to solve the mystery. Caspian’s protégé, Dr. Jeremiah Moon dubbed Sullivan “the Eleventh Question.” Together, the two solved numerous occult mysteries before Sullivan returned to his hermitage. Before doing so, he passed on his teachings to three Guardians of the Veil. These three Guardians did their best to continue Sullivan’s work, and their modern-day heirs continue on, answering the Eleventh Questions.</div><div>The Questions are considered, at best, eccentrics and, at worst, outcasts by the rest of the Guardians of the Veil. Publicly, they will defend the Questions as befits a member of their order. Privately, Guardians deride the Questions for unorthodox methods and an inattention to the priorities of the order. The Questions are driven to learn the truth at any cost, while the Guardians’ primary focus is to keep the Atlantean mysteries a secret. The Questions maintain that they are true defenders of the ideals of the Visus Draconis. In Atlantean times, the Eyes of the Dragon protected Atlantis from the subtle threats other orders could not hope to comprehend, much less confront. Only by honing the mind to the degree that the Questions do, are they able to face the threats that other mages (even other Guardians) can not. Only their continued successes have kept the Legacy alive. Many within the Guardians would prefer for the Questions to fail (either individually or en masse) so that the best minds can be brought back into the mainstream of the order.

The only constant in Question relations is the connection between tutor and pupil. Questions who are ready to take on pupils tend to retreat to their sanctums.

With the ability to ascertain the ultimate fate of a person or object with little chance of error, they cannot be fooled by empty promises or false appearances. Only a true destiny — or one cleverly disguised — warrants the full devotion of a mage.</div><div>But even with this Awakened perspective, alerting the mages to the relative importance of different people, places and things, there are few mages willing to divorce themselves from their other desires and ambitions in order to spend their lives defending destiny. Mages have the power within them to forge their own destinies, and it is a difficult choice to completely suborn such an unwritten fate to the needs of the Fallen World. Those few mages who make that choice are the unsung heroes of Awakened society. They give up their freedom and choose to be forever at the whim of others’ destinies.</div><div>Votaries of the Ordained spend their lives moving from one person or object, which they call a “charge,” to another, safeguarding it and its destiny against supernatural disturbance. Some stewardships pass without incidence, and the Votary moves on to another charge once the first charge meets its fate. Many Votaries of the Ordained are less fortunate. Because the things and people they guard are those that will, at some point, have an important and significant impact on the world, it is not uncommon for others to seek out these charges and tamper with their destinies in an attempt to manipulate the future to their own benefit. To this end, a Votary of the Ordained practices the physical arts of self-defense as well as the magical arts necessary to ensure the safety of her charge.</div><div>Young Votaries of the Ordained tend, at the recommendation of their teachers, to set themselves watch over smaller fates. An heirloom ring destined to become the symbol of engagement their fortune will dim. A bank vault will one day be used to safely contain a world-shaking secret, but only if the vault is not proven insecure. These are the destinies that moderately affect the future of the world but, if disturbed, can be repaired or replaced by an adept or master of the Fate Arcanum. More experienced Votaries of the Ordained, those who have mastered at least the second Attainment, take upon themselves the stewardship of greater destinies. Older Votaries of the Ordained sometimes watch over a single charge for decades.</div>",

Once a student has achieved the third Attainment, there are usually few communications along these lines. Still, a Votary’s only goal is to protect something, and if calling on old mentors and “cousins” in the Legacy may save an otherwise lost situation, it must be done.

In his view, the Abyss was a misalignment of key elements in this Eternal Movement. To restore the smooth functioning of the Mechanism of Creation, he concluded, mages must become Austere: pitiless, free of sentiment, even machinelike in their outlook. They must reject all trappings of mercy and compassion, which obscure one’s ability to perceive and correct the flaws that prevent the smooth functioning of reality.</div><div>Further contemplation — or derangement — convinced the Prime Mover that simply attempting a detached, mechanistic view of Creation was not enough. He and his inheritors would need to become machines in fact as well as in outlook. By replacing their body parts with superior mechanical analogs, the Austere would advance their detachment from their own humanity and increase their sympathetic connection to the Eternal Movement. While the Guardians nipped at the edges of the Abyss with their subtle and ineffective schemes, the Austere would seize control of it by spilling blood without hesitation or remorse.

Anachronistic design. The Austere are not cyborgs. Their mechanisms are not high technology, but exquisitely complex mechanical parts designed along Atlantean-based engineering principles that blur the line between science and magic. As their name implies, the Clockwork Mages favor a baroque assemblage of gears, cogs, wheels, pins, springs, shafts, wires, jewels and similar moving pieces.</div><div>2. Mundane appearance. Except when performing an obviously unnatural action, a Clocker’s artificial body part is indistinguishable from the real thing. The artificial part’s magical nature prevents it from triggering metal detectors. Viewed by x-ray or other imaging devices, the implants appear as featureless blurs that could be ascribed to scanning errors (which may raise suspicions, depending on the circumstance). Enhancements that have no human analog will, of course, never be mistaken for natural. If an enhancement is damaged, its organic façade is revealed for what it is: a thin skin covering a host of mechanisms within.</div><div>3. Mundane function. As long as the parts are functional, artificial parts are able to perform the mundane functions of the part they replace. An artificial hand is as sensitive and dexterous as the original; an artificial eye sees at least as well as the real thing. This is true even if the original was lost long before its replacement was added. A part that’s been damaged won’t heal, but may be repaired magically (with Matter 3 “Repair Object,” for example) or by mundane means. A damaged part may or may not maintain its mundane function, depending on the circumstances (Storyteller’s call).</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Sum of its Parts</h3>Use of the Cog in the Machine Attainment with a Clockworker’s mechanical parts is always limited by the Size of the added device.

Once the Mainspring is created, the mage enters a trance-like state in which the device magically implants itself somewhere in his chest or abdominal cavity, where it will establish a connection to his nervous system.</div><div>The Mainspring grants the mage these abilities:</div><div><i>Body Control:</i> The Mainspring can override the function of the Austere’s body in a manner similar to the Life 2 spell “Body Control.” For each dot the mage has in Life, he can halve the amount of oxygen he needs, double the time he can go without checking for fatigue or deprivation, add one to his Initiative, double the time it takes for poison or toxin to affect him and halve the healing time of bashing wounds. Each use of this ability lasts for one scene.</div><div><i>Hidden Agenda:</i> The Mainspring acts to shield the mage from any use of Life or Matter magic that might reveal his true nature.

A body part that’s replaced cannot be restored, so if the device breaks the mage suffers the consequences of living without the original (though the Attainment allows the inert device to remain in place without triggering an immune response). Should the mage’s Mainspring ever be destroyed or removed, his artificial body parts become partly inert, performing only mundane functions.</div><div>Before performing the Attainment, a Clockworker must design the desired device. This is an extended action with the target number depending on the body part mimicked (eight successes for a limb, 10 for an internal organ, 12 or more for a sensory organ). The mage rolls Intelligence + Science, with each roll representing a half-day of research and experiment. Once the design is complete, constructing the devise is another extended action, with each roll representing one day of uninterrupted work and meditation. The mage rolls either Intelligence or Dexterity + an appropriate skill (typically Academics, Crafts, Medicine, Occult or Science), with bonuses or penalties dependent on the equipment mage has available. If the mage is assisted during the design or construction process by another Clockworker — usually a tutor or pupil — apply the Teamwork rules from the World of Darkness rulebook, p. 134. (The mage receiving the device must be the primary actor.) The number of successes required for construction is the same as that for design.</div><div>For construction, failure to acquire enough success in a number of rolls equal to the mage’s Attribute + Skill indicates that the device fails and must be discarded. A dramatic failure indicates that the device seems to function, but once implanted will fail, becoming completely inert. The character will only discover this after undergoing the full, painful implantation process.</div><div>Once the device is constructed, this Attainment allows her to enter a trance state during which the object is activated and then implants or attaches itself to the mage’s body. This bloody and painful process takes one hour, after which the Clocker Mage must rest for at least 24 hours. A constructed device need not be implanted immediately.</div><div>Below are some possibilities; Storytellers are encouraged to create their own variations. Each mage can choose only one of these options. Should a mechanism be destroyed or damaged beyond repair, the mage can replace it with a similar device, but he must again undertake the full design and construction process.</div><div><b>Independent Hand</b></div><div><b>Effect:</b> The mage’s hand can detach itself and function somewhat autonomously, with Durability 3, Structure 4 and Speed 3 (by crawling or climbing). The mage can send the limb on a pre-assigned task — “Crawl over there and bring back that key” — or he can reflexively direct it mentally by sight or touch (the mage can feel through the hand as if it was still attached). If he is controlling the hand directly, the mage must take an instant action for the hand to perform a task. In addition, the mage can use his Cog in the Machine Attainment to temporarily add additional functions to the hand, either while attached or while it’s separated.</div><div><i>Variation:</i> Independent Eye. Instead of his hand, the mage replaces his eye. The mage’s eye and optic nerve can detach from his skull, and extend small legs allowing it to scuttle about (with the same traits as the hand, above). The mage can see whatever the eye sees. If the mage possesses Space 2, he can reflexively direct the eye’s movements regardless of distance; otherwise, if the eye leaves sensory range, he must concentrate to maintain contact with the eye (and he can’t regain contact if his concentration is ever broken). In addition, the mage can use his Cog in the Machine Attainment to temporarily add additional functions to the eye, either while attached or while it’s separated.</div><div><b>Prehensile Eyes</b></div><div><b>Effect:</b> The mage’s eyes can extend from their sockets on articulated stalks up to four feet long. This allows the mage to see into a small space, around corners or anywhere else the eye can fit. The mage can enhance the eyes’ vision with appropriate sensory spells. If she chooses to extend both eyes at once, she can duplicate the effects of the Space 1 spell “Omnivision.” The mage can use the Cog in the Machine Attainment to temporarily add additional functions to the eyes, either while they’re extended or while in place.</div><div><b>Implanted Weapon</b></div><div><b>Effect:</b> The mage installs a single melee weapon, or several small ones, inside his body. Examples include a blade or spike inside the arm, razor-like teeth that retract into the jaws or a strangling wire inside the wrist. The weapon can be accessed or hidden at will as an instant action and remains attached to the mage when in use. Once per scene, the mage can bestow the armor-piercing quality upon the weapon. Per the Matter 3 spell of that name, for each dot of Matter the mage possesses, the next and subsequent dice rolls made using the object are granted armor-piercing status.</div><div><b>Circulation Upgrade</b></div><div><b>Effect:</b> The mage’s circulatory system has been altered, so that when this enhancement is activated, her blood is infused with a sticky, viscous oil. This fluid causes any tears in the mage’s skin to seal themselves, stopping blood loss. For each point of Mana the mage expends, she may heal one lethal wound or two bashing wounds. Note that this doesn’t repair damage to the Austere’s mechanical body parts.</div><div><b>Secondary Body</b></div><div><b>Effect:</b> The mage creates a tiny automaton that is stored in his chest cavity. Once released, the device unfolds itself into a human-like form that stands one-fifth the size of the mage. While the mage enters a trance state and concentrates, he can project his awareness into the puppet, operating it and perceiving through it as if it were his own body. The device has the same Physical and Mental Attributes as the mage, including Health and Defense (except that the device’s Size is 1), and uses the mage’s Mental Attributes when active. The mage cannot cast spells while he is operating the small body, but any spell that he casts upon himself before activating the device will affect the automaton as well. As the device has no mind of its own, it can only operate under the mage’s direction. If the automaton moves out of sensory range, the mage must concentrate to maintain contact with it unless he has Space 2 or greater (in which case maintaining control is a reflexive action). If the automaton is destroyed or contact is broken, the mage’s consciousness returns to his body without harm.</div>",

Many Free Councilors are dedicated to revolutionary ideals, but few as much as the Blank Badges, who craft their very souls toward the overthrow of the Lie and all who support it, who give up their own identities in a quest for a greater identity, and a greater destiny, for all.</div><div>This Legacy is descended from one of the first cabals of the Free Council, formed during the Nameless War. These outcast mages took their Nameless status as a badge of honor, wearing white or blank badges as a sign of their allegiances, or some other white token, from a flower to a handkerchief. They said the white was for purity, but it also represented limitless potential, a clearing away of all the detritus of centuries of mystical tradition that bound the so-called Atlantean orders in chains of expectations and limitations. To be a mage, according to the Blank Badges, was to cast off such things and to embrace limitless potential and possibilities.</div><div>The cabal survived the Nameless War and the formation and recognition of the Free Council, eventually becoming a true Legacy that forged and reshaped the souls of young mystics initiated into its ways. Not all survived, because the Blank Badges explored the edges of mystical knowledge, fighting to push back the boundaries, while at the same time defying the power of the Seers of the Throne and their Exarch masters. Better to burn out than the fade away was their motto long before it came into vogue amongst the Sleepers.</div><div>For decades, the Badges have been on the forefront of the war against the agents of the Lie, but theirs is a secret war, much as the Nameless War between the Atlantean orders that created their Legacy. Blank Badges have been a part of rebellions around the world, seeking to cast off the established order to create something new. They have also fought in the shadows, unseen and unsung by any save the most perceptive of the Guardians and wisest of the Mysterium. The Badges have had to, since the enemy their fight against is conformity, expectation, the Lie of mundane existence.</div><div>In recent years, the Blank Badges have undergone an internal revolution as well. An increasing number of initiates of the Legacy have realized the Free Council is becoming (has become, according to some) as much as part of the occult “establishment” as any of the other Atlantean orders. The fifth point of the so-called Pentacle has gone from hot and fluid as an eruption to cooling and hardening into unyielding stone. As so many revolutionaries before them, Free Councilors are becoming the New Order, and the Blank Badges don’t like the sound of that at all. Therefore, the Legacy has gone from the core of the movement to the periphery of it, pushed out by their own nature, where they continue to follow the Legacy of their souls: revolution, evolution and defiance of expectations.</div><div>Their revolutionary nature keeps the Blank Badges on the forefront of the struggle against the Exarchs and their servants, the Seers of the Throne. While the Seers have largely lumped the Free Council in with the Atlantean orders since the Nameless refused to ally with the Seers more than a century ago, they remain keenly aware of the Invisible Company due to their penchant for provoking Paradox and stirring up trouble, to say nothing of their habit of killing Seers when they have the opportunity.</div><div>Some Pentacle mages try to keep the Blanks from drawing too much attention to the mystical community, because it only leads to Seer offensives and crackdowns, but others see the activities of the Legacy as a useful smokescreen. While the Seers deal with magical bomb-tossing anarchists, they have less attention to devote to harassing other members of the occult community. The Blanks, of course, see order mages who try to stay their hand as Exarch apologists and collaborators, traitors to the cause.</div><div>The Blanks therefore exist on the outer edges of Awakened society, acknowledged as members of the Free Council and afforded the protection of Awakened tradition and protocol, even if they don’t respect it themselves. They work with other mages when circumstances require it, but the Blanks don’t trust anyone, often not even members of their own Legacy, because they know the Lie extends its influence everywhere, and is not so easily thrown off as other willworkers might like to believe.</div>",

For some, this means adopting the most outlandish appearance they can, from radical punk to fetish and modern tribal styles, the better to shock people and make them remember only the shock and not the person behind it. Others take a subtler approach, looking just like everyone else, except for that gleam of rebellion in their eyes, that touch of defiance in their stance and their walk and the ubiquitous blank badge worn or displayed somewhere on their person.  Either way, Blank Badges don’t go in for traditional mystical symbols or trappings: you won’t find many (if any) wearing pentacles, runes or the signs of dead gods, much less “Atlantean” symbols, except as some sort of ironic poke at mages of the Atlantean orders.

This does not necessarily mean all Blank Badges come from mundane backgrounds; some start out as outcasts and freaks, the kind of people others pretend not to notice and studiously avoid.

The Legacy isn’t a complete anarchy, or else it wouldn’t exist as a Legacy at all.

They tend to work together in small cabals, typically known as “cells” and make use of the cellular structure that has served resistance movements around the world and across history. Each cell has limited contact with other cells, and therefore cannot compromise more than their immediate contacts if they or their information are captured.<div>Despite their revolutionary ideals, Blank Badges tend to recruit and initiate the old-fashioned way: one-on-one, teacher to student. In fact, some young mages found and taught by a member of the Invisible Company know little to nothing about the Pentacle or the history of the Atlantean orders. Their teachers see no reason to pass along any “Atlantis” nonsense and don’t proclaim themselves members of any order, so some of their students don’t even know they’re in the FreeCouncil(by default lineage, if nothing else),they believe the Blank Badges are the whole of it, unaware their “secret society” just scratches the surface of a much deeper occult world.</div>",

        "descrizione": "<div>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was in the Supernal Realm, and the Word was the Supernal Realm. So say the Cryptologos, the Legacy of the “Hidden Word.” Words, language, are the first true magic, the power of the Awakened or conscious mind. Language allowed humanity to express and share thoughts, to communicate effectively, to survive and to build a civilization. Without it, humans are no better than cunning animals; with it, their potential is limitless.</div><div>While there have always been mystics interested in the intricacies of language, and the Cryptologos draw upon their traditions, the Legacy itself is fairly recent in origin. The Legacy’s roots are dug into the science of language, the modern development of linguistics and, later, concepts such as ur-languages, root language and neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). Mages, just as mundane scientists, asked the questions: Where did language come from? How did it develop? How do we turn abstract and arbitrary sounds into meaning? Of course, the willworkers had something of an advantage in that they could study High Speech, what they believed was the true root of all human language.</div><div>Of course, the Cryptics were not so sanguine about the myths of Atlantis and the Fall of the Celestial Ladder. They believed High Speech was a kind of ur-language but not necessarily that it was proof of an ancient island nation of mage-kings who challenged the gods. Instead, most of the younger mystics who became the founders of the Legacy saw the Atlantis myth as just that, a metaphor, an interpretation of a time when language first developed and wielded power over not just our perception and definition of reality, but reality itself.</div><div>The “fall” for the Cryptologos is not a failed rebellion against Celestial forces, but a splintering of the true root language, High Speech, into diverse dialects and tongues, none with the true power of the First Language to encompass and define reality. High Speech became polluted and drifted, and so humanity fell asleep, because they could not longer truly communicate with the world around them or each other.</div><div>The rejection of the history and orthodoxy of the Atlantean traditions ensured the scholars of the Hidden Word were outcasts, called radicals or heretics. They continue to research and expand their theories on their own, and find like-minded willworkers as allies in the struggle against the ignorance and dogma of the Atlantean orders. The Hidden Word’s discoveries lent weight to their theories as the first Wordsmiths began shaping their souls to match their knowledge of High Speech and their voices were truly heard for the first time. Even masters of the old orders were impressed (and concerned) at the words of power rolling off the tongues of these rebellious new mages.</div><div>Although the Cryptologos learned that the Hidden Word was a source of power and influence, their true goal was always knowledge and understanding. They rejected the ways of the Diamond only because of their close-mindedness. So when the Nameless War came to an end and the Seers of the Throne offered an alliance, eager for the secrets the Cryptics and others had discovered and forged in the fires of conflict, most of the members of the Legacy refused. They would not turn their wisdom to domination and control. Some lore of the Hidden Word found its way into the Seers’ hands, and it is something the mages of the Legacy don’t like to discuss to the present day.</div><div>In the Free Council, the Cryptologos found allies and supporters for their theories and an environment where they could pursue their studies, seeking to reconstruct the First Language and, in the decades since, they have continued: seeking out ancient ruins, looking for tablets, carvings, crumbling scrolls and ancient, preserved texts. They collect songs, poems and lore, sifting through them for hints about words in High Speech, and they design elaborate programs intended to compare root-words from hundreds of languages in hopes of rediscovering lost elements of the First Speech.</div><div>Although the Hidden Words rejected Atlantean orthodoxy at their founding, they have taken on a strongly mystical bent of their own, their quest for the truth of High Speech consuming them. Many Cryptics believe that reassembling the scattered True Language is the key to bridging the Abyss and healing the rift between the Supernal and Fallen Worlds. Indeed, the Cryptics see that rift as a gulf of ignorance, a manifestation of the sundering of language that occurred in the Fall of the Celestial Ladder. While many Cryptologos maintain a fairly detached and scientific view of their research, others are fanatical devotes of the Hidden Word, believing that the final keystone in their search is the True Name of Creation, which will bring about a new age when it is known and spoken once more.</div>",

They’re typically bookish and look as if they spend a great deal of time indoors, although some adventuresome Wordsmiths are tomb raiders who don’t fit the stereotype. They’re most often well educated and certainly well-read. Spectacles are practically a part of the Legacy’s accoutrements, although not quite as commonly as they once were when Cryptics did all their reading and writing by firelight. Academic styles of dress are fairly common, and you’ll still find Cryptologos given to wearing tweed jackets and school ties.<div>More than appearance, what the Hidden Words tend to have in common is their sound: Wordsmiths tend to all be well-spoken and skilled in turning a phrase. They’re not all great orators or singers (although many are), but they have a way of enunciating and speaking firmly and clearly. Of course, they also have large vocabularies, and many are overly fond of showing them off (while the rest know better and match their speech to the occasion).</div>",
        "background": "The Hidden Words most often come from academic or literary backgrounds, people most concerned with language and words. A love of language from an early age is one of their hallmarks, as is their tendency toAwaken through the medium of language. Some talented Cryptics recall understanding bits and pieces of High Speech even before their Awakening, regarded as no more than “baby talk” or glossolalia by others. Some pursued tantalizing hints of the First Language, discovering greater truths than they could have imagined, and all of the Hidden Words stress the moment when they wrote their names within the Watchtowers, usually their first true use of High Speech.<div>Most of the current generation of Cryptologos found mentors in the Legacy before or not long after Awakening, so they were taught the Legacy from the beginning. Others found their way to the Hidden Words from the ranks of the Free Council, with a small handful of mages drawn to the Legacy from the other Atlantean orders by the power of the Word. Similar to other Free Councilors, Cryptics tend toward a modern and what they consider “realistic” attitude about magic, the Awakened world, and mystic history. Just as language is a metaphor, so they tend to consider much of the occult symbolism of the mystic world a metaphor for greater truths, captured in the words of High Speech.</div>",
        "organizzation": "The Cryptologos are of an organized bent, perhaps one of the most organized Legacies associated with the somewhat anarchistic Free Council. The Assembly and Lorehouse systems currently used by the order came about with more than a little influence from the Hidden Words, and the Cryptics remain strongly involved with both, since there are few things the Cryptics like better than a good discussion and collecting and organizing arcane lore. Likewise, Cryptologos are often found as emissaries or syndics for the Free Council, given their way with words, and they serve Assemblies as representatives and as counselors, providing advice and insight.<div>Within the Legacy itself, Cryptologos are true to the democratic ideals of the Free Council. Their cabals are most commonly found in urban areas in or around centers of learning, especially universities noted for the linguistic arts and sciences. Cryptics also crop up in the arts scenes of urban communities, particularly the open-mike coffeehouse culture, although not quite as often as they did in the days of the Beat poets. Hidden Word cabals allow equal opportunities to voice opinions, and the Wordsmiths all have opinions and the willingness to talk about them, usually at great length. This gives them a reputation for debating everything but doing nothing, at least until circumstances force their hand.</div>",

The first was the explosion of the Cosmic All, the fiat lux that brought Creation into being and made the Supernal and Fallen Worlds, back before the Abyss separated them and they were all a part of one Creation, one true world. But that explosion only made space and time, matter and energy. The second explosion came from the human mind, and it created everything else: language, tools, mathematics, art, dance, cities, laws, literature, science, technology, religion, poetry, war, history. It created magic. Everything in the world made by human hands, and human ideas came out of the human mind and soul, the human imagination.</div><div>After all, what is magic except the ability to imagine something that doesn’t yet exist and make it real? The Awakened can do so directly, but Sleepers have to do it the hard way, and some Imagineers wonder who gets the better part of that deal; they admire fine craftsmanship, after all, and there’s a great deal to be said for having to work for something rather than having it given to you. Still, the mages of this Legacy believe in using what you are given to its fullest extent, and in the magic of creation and imagination.</div><div>Although there have always been crafters with a touch of the arcane to them, the Imagineers trace their origins to the development of the science of psychology and the study of the mind. In particular, they owe many of their ideas to theories about dreaming, imagination and the universal unconscious. Young willworkers in the 19th century studied these ideas, and placed the mind at the summit of the mystic hierarchy. The Temenos, they claimed, was the source of all things that could be imagined, thus the entire contents of the mind was born there, and all creations of the mind had their roots deep in that realm.</div><div>If all things of the mind ultimately came from the Temenos, they reasoned, then that realm was a treasure trove of all that could ever possibly be imagined. It was simply a matter of exploring deeply enough to find what the dream consciousness of Creation had to offer, and to bring those nuggets of inspiration back and manifest them in the Fallen World, like divers plumbing the ocean depths for pearls and sunken treasure. The Imagineers swore not only to explore hitherto unknown realms of thought, but to bring them to the people.</div><div>While they earned praise for their bold willingness to explore the astral planes, the proto-Imagineers bought the scorn of the Atlantean orders with the coin of skepticism. For all the Imagineers’ love of imagination and its wonders, they were materialists and dualists, dividing all Creation into things of the First Creation (that of the formation of the Tapestry) and things of the Second Creation (the fruits of the imagination). More importantly, they placed most, if not all, occult and spiritual lore in the second category. Gods, spirits, eidolons, eikones, powers and principalities were all the offspring of human genius, the Imagineers said. Real and independent entities they might be (with an emphasis on might), but they originated in the womb of dreams, born out of human consciousness.</div><div>Such attitudes earned the Imagineers no friends within the Atlantean orders (the gods, for their part, largely remained silent on the matter). This suited the Dreamsmiths well enough, as they were more interested in exploring the potential of Creation, not cataloging and endlessly re-reading its past like the hidebound Atlantean orders. They joined the ranks of the new generation of willworkers in repudiating the orders, leading to the Nameless War. For their part, the Imagineers had little to do with the war, apart from providing aid and comfort to their allies.</div><div>Once the conflict ended, however, the Idealists were quick to surface from their explorations of the Astral depths to put forth some of the many ideas they discovered. They called for the new order to be founded upon reason tempered with imagination and a sense of wonder, and for the wealth of ideas to be shared amongst all. They were strong proponents for the Lorehouse system adopted by the Free Council, and gave freely of their stores of knowledge and inspiration (even if some of those ideas were a bit crackpot, even by Free Council standards).</div><div>Modern Imagineers often cite the Nameless War and the formation of the Free Council as a turning point in history, and point to the explosion of progress since. The vistas of the imagination have expanded, they say, and one day soon those borders will not only touch the edges of the Abyss, but pass over it, reconnecting humanity with the Supernal World.</div>",

Similar to many artists, they tend to be given to flamboyance, although some Dreamsmiths are so focused on their inner lives they neglect their outer beings: wearing whatever is at hand and paying little attention to the niceties of grooming, at least while they’re working. Some Imagineers have hands (and clothing) stained with paint, ink or other artistic media, and many have the supple and dexterous hands of artists. Still, the mind and the imagination are what matter most to their Legacy, so outward appearance is ultimately of little importance.<div>Imagineers tend to be enthusiastic, some even manic, when it comes to their explorations. They’re dreamers and shapers, and love nothing more than spilling out new ideas and wonders.

On the one hand, there are the scientists and scholars of the mind, interested in psychology, psychotherapy, dream research and so forth. They seek the roots of human consciousness and inspiration, plumbing the depths of the Universal Unconscious to see just how far it goes. They’re most interested in the interconnectiveness of the Temenos and what it means for the realms of thought, consciousness and imagination.<div>On the other side are the artists and dreamers, the visionaries who live much of their lives immersed in the Temenos, new ideas and inspiration constantly bubbling to the surface or dredged up from the depths. They’re most drawn to the process of creation, bringing ideas into manifestation and, they hope, adding a bit more light to the shadows of the Fallen World. Their interest is in imagination as a magical tool, both literally and figuratively.</div><div>While there is some friction between the two aspects of the Imagineers, it is dynamic and creative for the most part. The two sides of the Legacy complement each other: the scientists and scholars offering organization, discipline and a solid foundation, while the artists have energy, inspiration and a willingness to go off in new directions just to see what there is to see.

        "descrizione": "<div>Magic is at its heart a mystery. No one knows, or perhaps has ever known exactly how or why it works — why the 10 Arcana are arranged as they are, what creates the various limits on magic or why some few human awaken and most remain forever cut off from the Supernal World. The vast majority of mages consider these questions best suited for philosophers. Instead, most mages with an interest in theory focus their efforts on practical goals, such as creating new rotes, finding more efficient methods of harvesting Mana or easier ways to create imbued items.</div><div>However, just as Sleepers with an interest in science occasionally turn their intellects to abstract pursuits such as theoretical physics, some mages seek to investigate the nature of magic itself. The most devoted of these students of magic often choose to pursue this Legacy. The Eyes of Ain Soph are mages who dedicate themselves to learning to understand magic in its most complex and powerful manifestations. The Legacy is after the eternal and formless light that represents pure, raw divinity as yet unmanifested in the Kabalistic Tree of Life, a realm of perfect enlightenment and mystical understanding, the members of this Legacy seek to understand the totality of magic. As a result, their Attainments are a mixture of abilities that aid their observations and those that allow the mages to remain safe while performing these observations. Mages who pursue this Legacy are often obsessed with understanding the secrets and intricacies of magic.</div><div>One of the central tenants of this Legacy is that the knowledge of magic is inherent in the structure of magic and so the best way to understand how and why the various Arcana work as they do is to experiment with them. A very few Seekers, as the members of this Legacy are frequently called, confine their efforts to working out lengthy theories about the nature of magic. However, the vast majority believe that theory cannot be separated from practice in any useful fashion and spend much of their time examining and experimenting with various unusual types of magic’s and various unusual phenomena. Most members of this Legacy are tireless in their pursuit of new styles of magic. They regularly seek out the oldest or most obscure rotes they can find in the hope that some features in these magical formulas will reveal some deeper truth about magic. These mages tirelessly study newly discovered rotes and any notes about magical theory written by those who created these rotes. However, these same Seekers also actively experiment with any new rotes they find, seeking unusual quirks or advantages in their use.</div><div>In their efforts to further understand the nature of magic, many Seekers also attempt to learn as much as they can about the various other unusual phenomena found in the World of Darkness. Some study the limited mortal phenomena of thaumaturgy or psychic powers (see Second Sight for further information on both phenomena); others become fascinated with the Abyss and the various intruders into reality (see Intruders: Encounters with the Abyss for further information). Some Seekers attempt to learn all they can about the various other supernatural beings who also inhabit the World of Darkness, and many seek to learn all they can about Twilight, the Shadow Realm and the spirits that inhabit it. Because of these studies, many Seekers amass large collections of esoteric books and occult relics, ranging from decades-old books on psychic powers, vials of vampire blood and strange relics physically retrieved from the Shadow Realm or the Underworld. Although most other mages care little for these exotic collections, various supernatural beings and occasionally mortal thaumaturges or even powerful spirits can take an interest in the items in these collections, and so many Seekers protect their more exotic itemswith potent wardings.</div><div>Although many Seekers are quite methodical in their investigations, some of their research is inherently dangerous, and most are perfectly willing to take significant risks when investigating unknown phenomena such as newly discovered artifacts, magically protected ancient ruins or unique spirits. Although some Seeker Attainments are designed to help protect Seekers from the negative consequences of these investigations, some degree of risk often remains, which has given the Seekers a general reputation as mages who often meddle in matters best left alone. A few outsiders consider Seekers to be dangerous, but most believe that Seekers simply have an over-developed death wish, and many mages who lack the protections granted by this Legacy remove themselves from the vicinity of any major Seeker investigation.</div><div>Although this reputation is often far from deserved, it is also true that many Seekers are sufficiently determined in their efforts to learn the secrets of magic that they regularly engage in magical experiments that entail some degree of risk. However, few members of this Legacy are daredevils, and almost none are particularly careless. The vast majority are obsessive researchers who make certain that they can repeat any successes and avoid having any particular failure or serious problem occur more than once.</div>",

However, most Seekers who have followed this Legacy for more than a short time have a keen interest in safety and spend as much time examining and checking any safety gear they may require as the most fashion-conscious dilettante spends on her appearance and grooming. Some Seekers are well-spoken and outgoing and express their interests with loud and effusive enthusiasm, while others are shy and are more comfortable recording their conclusions in writing, but all Seekers seem to come more alive when preparing for, engaging or speaking about their researches.",

However, formal academic training and credentials are not a requirement for membership. A sincere commitment to studying magic and an understanding of the techniques of scientific study are both considered far more important than where or how someone obtained his knowledge. As a result, some members are passionate autodidacts, and a few are mystics and shamans who seek profound truths and ultimate enlightenment through visionary journeys and deep and lengthy meditations or collectors of eccentric relics who endeavor to learn to use and understand the strange and sometimes dangerous magical oddities in their collection. Regardless of their methods, those who choose to pursue this Legacy tirelessly attempt to understand the world’s most difficult and complex secrets through a mixture of theory and practice that requires a combination of time, dedication and occasionally significant risk.",
        "organizzation": "Members of the Eyes of Ain Soph maintain close, but somewhat impersonal, contact with one another. Because many are scholars or academics of one sort or another, they are most comfortable with the trappings of academic culture. As a result, the members of this Legacy work together to discreetly published a journal (written partly in Atlantean High Speech to maintain secrecy), maintain several email lists and hold a yearly conference, where the various members share their findings and critique one another’s research. This conference is also used as an opportunity for members to meet others working on similar projects and to organize joint projects.<div>Although many of the members of this Legacy have idiosyncratic theories and are most comfortable working alone, when they encounter a member working on a similar project, they almost always welcome the aid and alternative viewpoint that collaboration can bring. New members learn the secrets of this Legacy by working as assistants to other members. Members almost always take on only assistants whose ideas and theories are similar to the members’ own. As a result, even once Visionaries have become fully members of this Legacy, they are often interested in working with their former teachers on projects of mutual interest.</div><div>The other major way in which the members work together involves dealing with the large collections of unusual magical relics that some members possess. While some Seekers keep their various unusual acquisitions to themselves, others are interested in both showing off their more interesting items and in having other mages provide insights into any possible revelations or theories that can be obtained by examining these items. Seekers are never simply greedy hoarders of magic. They wish to use the unusual items they often collect as tools to uncover hidden truths about magic. As a result, most consider permitting other serious scholars to access these items to be the best way to wrest the maximum amount of knowledge from any oddities they possess.</div>",

        "descrizione": "<div>In ancient times, Gaelic funerary traditions included the “keening” of a lost soul, a tradition that, under other names, has also been found in some parts of eastern Europe and the Far East. After an individual died, women of his family, village, clan or tribe would gather together and enter into a formalized mourning for the departed. Unlike modern funerary rituals that are often somber and near-silent affairs, keeners wept and wailed, bemoaning the loss of the departed soul while extolling his virtues at great length and volume. They shared stories and songs of his wisdom, strength and generosity, accompanied by swaying, chanting or rhythmic clapping in ritualized mourning ceremonies that carried on for days. The more formal aspects of the keening were frequently interspersed with bouts of distraught moaning and tears as the keeners showed their despondency at the loss of such a great person. </div><div>The more powerful, well-known or loved an individual was, the louder and longer his mourners would keen his loss, leading to long and often outlandish spectacles after the death of particularly popular people. Such bits of drama also provided something of an “emotional screen” — in the presence of such a spectacle, those who might not normally allow themselves to grieve could do so without shame. </div><div>The more important the mourners at the funeral, the greater honor was accorded to the deceased. Thus, while a veritable army of mourners might attend a funeral, should noblewomen or other ladies of importance appear and mourn openly, they lent some of their prestige to the deceased. Some families even claimed that their families were so integral to the soul of Ireland that the fairy women came to mourn the passing of their scions. Some even claimed that the fairy women mourned them before their deaths — such families have their own bean sídhe, or banshee, who presage their deaths. </div><div>Even among the Singers in Silence themselves, the origins of the Legacy are uncertain. Oral tradition has almost certainly enhanced and manipulated the facts of the Banshee creation tale, although, as with many of the spoken Mysteries, the Truth of the story remains. What is known is that a woman of early Ireland, Brea, who led her tribe in their struggles against the Fomorii, is accorded the honor of being first of the Singers in Silence. </div><div>The Banshee are oftentimes misunderstood by those outside of the Legacy, and more than once in their history, they have been in danger of being labeled as Left-Handed. In truth, however, while some Singers have certainly been driven mad by their Attainments and nudged well into the dark ways, the Legacy is no more Left-Handed than fate — or death — itself. </div><div>Favor (and fear) of the Bean Sídhe have waxed and waned during the history of the Pentacle. During some time periods, the Singers were actively hunted. During the Great Depression, a male Singer was alleged to have “aided” in the suicides of more than a thousand Sleepers when financial disaster struck, leaving them and their families with few options for survival. Arguing that his victims “wanted it, begged for it,” the Banshee was brought up on trial by his local Consilium, and the proceedings erupted into violence and fervor that eventually led to his destruction after he publicly threatened to use his Attainments on not only the members of the jury council but also on their Sleeper families as well.</div><div>However, in other times, the Banshee have gained a reputation as useful and dedicated counselors: the life of a mage is rarely a peaceful one, and the costs of standing against the Lie are often high. When grief strikes deep within the heart of an Awakened, threatening to send him mad with rage or depression,  a Singer is sometimes able to reach within and aid the mage in purging herself of the pain. Such interventions, however, are rarely called upon in anything but the most dire of circumstances; even in the best of times, few who have heard the legends of the Banshee are willing to risk asking for their aid.</div><div>Mystagogues from outside of the Legacy sometimes attempt to use the Banshee’s inherent relationship with departed souls to glean information that is otherwise difficult to obtain or confirm. However, considering the Banshee’s reputation as the harbingers of death, only the bravest are willing to look Singers in the eye and risk seeing the reflection of their death in the Banshee’s gaze.</div><div>As for the Banshee themselves, few foster relationships with the Awakened with any more attention than with Sleepers. The particular flavor of Death Sight inflicted upon them by their Attainments shows no favoritism; doomed is doomed, whether Awakened or Sleeper. Thus, socializing with other mages is no more comfortable for a Singer than interacting with Awakened individuals.</div>",

        "appearance": "Although a Bean Sídhe may believe herself to be inured to the constant exposure to the mortality around her, the burden is constantly apparent to those around her. Those who take on this Legacy grow skeletally thin, as if eaten away by a hunger that no amount of food or drink can wholly sate. Their features become sunken, their body bony and, by the later Attainments, their skin pales to an ashen gray, regardless of their racial heritage.<div>While Sleeper legends attribute only feminine traits to the Banshee, not all Singers in Silence are female. Historically speaking, however, a disproportionately large number have been, and many traditional Bean Sídhe will not consider taking a male student in the Legacy. The reasons for this vary. Some, especially those who are most devoted to rediscovering and preserving the ancient mysteries of the British Isles, believe that to introduce men to the Legacy is an affront to the memory of Brea and her cabal sisters.</div>",
        "background": "Banshee come from no single background. While most experience a great tragedy immediately before entering the Legacy, for some this was a single traumatic event in an otherwise happy existence, while for others it was merely the culmination of years of misery and pain.<div>Despite the name, not all Singers were musically inclined before entering the Legacy, either. Their keening song is as often a product solely of their Attainment as it is a predisposition toward musical expression. Some, although certainly not all, had an interest in the Celtic culture or history before being approached by the mentor who would eventually induct them into the Legacy. A good number of these were involved, as mystagogues, in researching and preserving the oral traditions of early civilizations, but just as many were Curators or Censors, rather than directly being involved in the acquisition of lost knowledge.</div><div>Most of the Singers are female as well. However, in truth, Singers may come from any walk of life, culture, sex or race, and may be any age when entering the Legacy. Their commonality is more likely to be the tragedy that brings them to the path than their past history.</div>",
        "organizzation": "The mentor-student bond between generations of the Singers in Silence is the pre-dominant link that ties the Legacy together; little organizational structure exists within the Legacy outside of those ties. Those who have first entered the Legacy tend to cling tightly to their teachers for a time; after all, few but other Singers can truly understand the burden their Attainments bestow upon them. Banshee mentors not only tutor their students in the Legacy itself, but also often act as grief counselors, aiding them in transitioning through the cataclysmic event that leads most Banshee to this path.<div>However, no matter how vital the Legacy was to their recovery from whatever tragedy goaded them into entering it, in time most Banshee come to resent their teachers with an unyielding vigor. The burdens Banshee receive as a part of their first Attainment are weighty, and eventually most students come to blame their teachers for having ever offered the Legacy to them. This reaction, and the resultant separation between student and mentor, is so common among the Banshee that the phenomenon has its own name. Students leaving are said to be “in waning,” a separation that may only last days or weeks, but in some cases can go on for years. Almost inevitably, however, a waning Singer finds that her burden is, if anything, greater when borne alone, and will return to her mentor for additional training after a period of separation. This cycle often repeats itself after each Attainment.</div><div>Occasionally, a Banshee mentor will spend years or decades gathering a group of students around her to aid with resolution of a major or ongoing tragedy. These groups, called Choirs, sometimes stay together for lengthy periods, but most often go their own separate ways once the immediate issue at hand is resolved. This is in part because in proximity to each other the Banshee all suffer the effects of each one’s personal torment: a malicious or mischievous ghost who plagues one of the Singer plagues them all, and when this is increased five-or six-fold the situation can quickly become unbearable. As well, a larger group of Singers is more likely to draw the attention of others (Sleeper and Awakened alike), who misunderstand the nature of Singers’ Attainments. The likelihood of repercussions from those who do not understand or agree with Banshee duties is far greater when gathered as a group, while a solitary Banshee’s impact on an area is more easily hidden.</div>",

Unlike many other Legacies, the first-level Attainment for the Singers in Silence is constantly active. It cannot be turned off, and is almost impossible to ignore. Because of the disturbing nature of this ability, once the first Attainment is achieved, Banshees typically spend less and less time among others. The reclusiveness caused by this change in perspective is only reinforced by the reputation that Banshee frequently earn as their Attainments progress, eventually leading most Singers to virtual hermitage. At the higher Attainments, many Banshees interact with humanity only under the most dire and unpreventable of circumstances. Those rare Singers who maintain regular interaction with others after attaining the highest level of Attainment within their Legacy often are only able to do so because they have established a great enough separation from their emotional reactions to what they see around them that they are no longer tormented by them.",

When Fate decrees that death is eminent for an individual, however, those who have achieved the first Attainment of this Legacy are blessed — or cursed — with this knowledge, whether they want it or not. While this can be very useful, the form this knowledge takes is both vivid and disturbing. The dead and death-touched resonate with a Singer’s soul, invoking lilting chords only she can hear. With respect to the dead, the mage can always hear and speak with ghosts as if she cast the Death 1 “Speak with the Dead” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 135) with successes equal to her Death dots, but she cannot actually see ghosts or perceive other entities. Additionally, the mage hears the silent dirge of death’s touch, giving her the permanent auditory equivalent of the Death 1 “Grim Sight” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 134). Through Fate, this awareness also reveals whether a living being is cursed or fated to die within the next day, though the mage cannot predict fatal accidents or deaths that have no particular significance to the pattern of destiny. This knowledge comes upon the Banshee unbidden. It cannot be wished away or easily ignored, and there is no time or place where the Banshee is immune to the potential interference of The Knowing, a fact that colors members of the Legacy in body, mind and spirit. Because of this Attainment’s distracting nature, Singers suffer a –2 penalty to actions requiring significant concentration (at the Storyteller’s discretion) while in the immediate presence of more ghosts and/or doomed individuals than their Composure + Gnosis rating.",

Those who are not ghosts experience such music with a vague sense of dread similar to a successful casting of the Mind 2 “Emotional Urging” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 207).

Mages can use this Attainment in two ways. First, they may sing or cry out a wordless lament to any Sleeper who can hear them as an instant action. If that individual dies within a number of days equal to the mage’s Death dots, his soul automatically lingers as a ghost with a single anchor representing the most pressing matters left unresolved by his death. As usual for ghosts created by unfinished business, the shade fades away as soon as it completes its task. The second use of this Attainment causes a Sleeper who died no more than a number of days equal to the mage’s Death dots to rise as a ghost, provided the mage sings at the site of the individual’s death or his primary physical remains. Such ghosts likewise exist to fulfill unfinished business. This Attainment does not grant any control over the ghosts The Keening creates, except that they cannot voluntarily attack the mage who sung them into being.",

Nothing can prepare a listener for the agony and horror of this cacophony. Each instant action spent crying out in this terrible voice inflicts one point of bashing damage to all Sleepers within earshot unless they have more Composure dots than the mage’s Fate dots. Because this music damages the soul rather than the body, injuries inflicted by the Attainment leave no physical marks. As a purely cosmetic side effect, the music also causes everyone who hears it to think of his greatest personal regret, which occasionally prompts wayward souls to reform their behavior if they survive the experience."

As a result, Sneaks are eager to observe and gain access to the world’s hidden places, including places purposefully hidden from thieves and intruders.</div><div>The major internal tension among the members of this Legacy is between those Sneaks who are fascinated by the various cracks and discontinuities in reality and those whose appreciation for these distortions of reality is purely practical and who find these cracks and faults in the Fallen World to be little more than exceptionally useful tools. Many Sneaks either seek to explore and understand the various breaks in reality or simply appreciate the beauty and wonder of such faults in space. However, an almost equal number see these cracks as little more than little-known and utterly invaluable paths to all manner of desirable goods. To many mages, Reality Stalkers have a reputation for being amoral thieves whose fascination with goods and knowledge belonging to others often verges on kleptomania.</div><div>Many Sneaks are more than happy to use their knowledge of the secrets paths through the fabric of reality to study or steal all manner of precious and useful items. The ease with which they can gain access to locations that are effectively impossible to access via mundane means has caused the Mysterium to look upon the Sneaks as one of the order’s primary tools in its continuing efforts to learn the secrets and collect the artifacts that others have hidden away. Because Sneaks’ travels avoid all risk of Paradox, they are usually far more willing to use their particular forms of transportation than other mages. However, almost half the members of this Legacy are dedicated, if often deeply eccentric and reckless, explorers who are more interested in exploring and understanding the nature of the fractures in reality than they are in exploiting them as a way to steal from others. In addition to taking great joy in using the Attainments of this Legacy, these mages also seek out various discontinuities in reality, including both ones created by ancient and powerful magics and those due to more exotic and mysterious causes, and seek to explore them using their Legacy and their magic. Because of the obvious dangers of this sort of exploration, occasionally members of this Legacy simply vanish and are never seen again, while others develop and unhealthy fascination with the Abyss and its denizens. Although this is not a Left-Handed Legacy, the fact that a not-insubstantial number of the members are either thieves or mages fascinated with the Abyss serves to make many mages wary of the Sneaks.</div>",

Some are shy and awkward, while others are simply quiet and carefully observant or sly and quietly manipulative. However, very few are flamboyant, outgoing, loud or inclined to express their emotions outwardly. Despite their nickname, few are furtive or suspicious-looking. Instead, most Sneaks are either people who are by nature easily and often overlooked, or they have mastered the difficult skill of knowing how to be unnoticed. Those who are not innately easy to overlook often learn ways of being quietly charming and seductive, and many Sneaks cultivate an air of mystery about them. The most impressive members of this Legacy all possess a quiet sense of authority and a soft-spoken charm, combined with a knack for avoiding the attentions of others when it is convenient to do so.",

This is also a Legacy frequented by computer hackers and cryptographers, as well as a large number of people who became fascinated or even obsessed with the most obscure and sometimes frightening mysteries of the World of Darkness. For many members, their interest in these mysteries often predates their Awakening by at least several years. One of the little-known facts of this Legacy is that more than a third of the members had some direct experience with some inhabitant of the Abyss before they joined this Legacy. Those whose lives have been touched by exposure to such exotic and sometimes unimaginable events frequently join this Legacy. These mages become fascinated with these events and seek to explain and understand them by using this Legacy to explore the world’s many hidden secrets. While most are not reckless seekers of knowledge about the Abyss, a fascination with secret or hidden knowledge is almost universal.",
        "organizzation": "Sneaks are by nature secretive and relatively solitary. As a result, Reality Stalkers do not share information as openly as the members of many other Legacies. Instead of freely sharing information, most Sneaks trade information — arranging in-person and online forums where members who wish help with interesting or complex problems can seek out others and offer services (or preferably information) in return for assistance with their problems or answers to their own questions. In addition to the obvious practical benefits, trading secrets is also one of the primary ways that members form social and personal ties with one Chapter Four: Factions and Legacies 175 another. The act of sharing knowledge known to almost no one else can be quite powerful, and members who regularly trade secrets with one another often become friends and allies. To facilitate these deals, many Sneaks make an effort to keep in loose touch with the other members of their Legacy. However, some are sufficiently solitary and secretive that they avoid these efforts, and the majority do their best not to reveal any important truths about themselves or their interests to anyone, including other members of this Legacy.",

However, the Sneak must scry through known flaws and cracks in reality and so must have seen the location he wishes to scry at least once before. As long as the mage has seen the location in person or in a high-quality photograph or video image of the location, he can scry there. To peer through the cracks in the world and observe the desired location (i.e., to open a scrying window), the mage’s player makes a Wits + Stealth + Space roll as an instant action, modified by sympathetic connections, as normal.

        "descrizione": "<div>Accomplished artisans and scholars often cling to the hope that their works will grant vicarious immortality in the canon of human civilization. Unfortunately, the whims of canon are fickle, and even the greatest geniuses might fall prey to censorship or obsolescence as newer discoveries supplant their work. While Awakened power affords more options, even willworkers can fall prey to desperation. Only then does the dream of the Unforgotten find them.</div><div>Rising from the murky depths of the Dreamtime to touch a mage’s subconscious during sleep or deep meditation, the Unforgotten manifests as a vast, undefined shape moving beneath a cold, black sea or glimpsed in silhouette behind thick ice. Cloaked in such perceptual metaphors, the Unforgotten murmurs in the polyphonic cacophony of every genius whose works have perished. In this borrowed chorus, the Unforgotten communicates its respect for the mage’s greatness and echoes his outrage that such greatness should ever fade from the world. The entity never bothers to surface unless a mage is already susceptible to such advances, but if rebuffed, it silently descends back into the Dreamtime until the clarion of desperation summons it again. Unless rejected, however, the presence remains, pressing gently at the back of the mage’s mind with the intimacy of a lover’s caress. Just as a perfect imaginary friend, the entity discusses its latest companion’s interests, patiently waiting when the mage must attend to conscious matters.</div><div>As the dialogue progresses, the Unforgotten begins offering useful advice. The entity does not command or plead, but carefully suggests better ways of preserving the mage’s ideas that culminate in the secrets of the first Attainment. From that epiphany onward, the new Dreamer joins the luminaries who have embraced the Unforgotten, bound inexorably and eternally to an idea greater than themselves.</div><div>New Unforgotten Scions feel increasingly justified to promote and preserve their works as a “greater good” that must not be contained by such artificial strictures as their order’s rules or even morality itself. Over time, these mages grow increasingly erratic and frustrated that those around them do not share their fervor, or worse, try to block their creative efforts. Such frustration usually gives way to paranoia and social isolation. In the absence of external companionship, Dreamers place increasing trust in the Unforgotten as the only being in the world that really understands and appreciates them. Its counsel becomes a constant companion, mixing practical advice with Socratic questions and the occasional enigmatic clue, encouraging scions to think for themselves and refine their own ideas.</div><div>Whatever the Dreamers’ interests and fields of study, the Unforgotten Scions are universally devoted to the genesis and propagation of their ideas. Any moral qualms that might limit such actions soon fall by the wayside as the madness of the desperate creator consumes them like divine fire. The Legacy’s Attainments only accelerate this decay, providing tools whereby others can be set ablaze with similar madness. All the while, the gentle voice of the Unforgotten encourages and advises from deep within, equal parts muse and succubus, steadfastly faithful to the dreams of the Dreamers rather than those who dream them.</div><div>Membership in the Mysterium is not a prerequisite for becoming an Unforgotten Scion, but it is a high risk factor. The order’s dedication to knowledge for the sake of knowledge opens the door for members to take that precept too far, losing their Wisdom to the incarnate hubris of the Unforgotten. Thankfully, long centuries of rooting out infections of the Legacy have given the Mysterium the practice and tools needed to do so. Mages who are too vocal in the promotion of their works past the point of reason can expect to be watched closely for the telltale Attainments and summarily dealt with if such evidence appears. While not as commonly afflicted, the Guardians of the Veil also lose their share of members to this Left-Handed Legacy when they allow the Mysteries they defend to become more important than the defenders themselves. Paradoxically, other orders suffer more when rare Unforgotten Scions emerge from their ranks, as the orders seldom have any idea what to look for and don’t know how to deal with the problem until it is too late. Opposition to the Legacy is further complicated by the fact that knowledge of the Unforgotten increases the likelihood of contact, so the orders prudently restrict and censor such research. Unfortunately, this results in many mages who don’t have the slightest clue what they are dealing with if it does find them.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Wait, It Does What ?</h3><div>Unlike most Legacies, the Unforgotten Scions exist as components of a self-aware ideology greater than the sum of its parts. In practical terms, this means a mage doesn’t need another member of the Legacy to initiate her or teach her new Attainments, as most learn directly from the Unforgotten. While this arrangement means that Dreamers effectively have a “teacher on tap” and needn’t worry about finding or maintaining contact with another member of their Legacy, the downside is that the link between “teacher” and student cannot be severed (voluntarily or otherwise) and does not break when a mage learns the third Attainment.

The Unforgotten does nothing to stop such conflicts, as it cares only for its personal relationships with each Scion and is entirely indifferent to how they interact amongst themselves. The strangest of the Dreamers are those who embrace the Unforgotten in support of a collective idea, with each member accepting that the work of the group is more important than themselves.

Even if this theory is correct, it doesn’t explain where the Unforgotten came from, though that doesn’t deter wild speculation of mad Oracles or the transcended daimon of the Legacy’s original founder. About the only thing scholars can definitively agree upon is that the Unforgotten has no ties to the Abyss, which seems strange given its association with corrupting madness. The perverse truth is that Dreamers actually oppose the Abyss by preserving and disseminating magical lore through the world, though most Awakened would quite happily do without such “help,” if given the choice.</div><div>While the full range of powers available to the Unforgotten remains unknown, it can definitely do all of the following.

Other Unforgotten Scions are immune to this damage. Optional Arcanum: Prime 3 If the mage also knows Prime 3, she may create a more advanced form of grimoire than conventional Arcana normally allows. Creating this text requires the usual rolls and effort for a rote casting of the Prime 1 “Inscribe Grimoire” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 220). If the roll is successful, however, the text does not strip the rote from the mage’s mind. More dramatically, mages and Sleepwalkers can use the cursed texts to cast rotes for spells they would otherwise lack the necessary Arcana to cast, rolling Gnosis alone (or spending a point of Willpower to gain three dice for the casting, if the reader possesses neither Gnosis nor Arcana). There is a catch, of course. Whenever a mage learns a spell from a Dreamer’s grimoire or a character casts a rote by consulting such a text, she must reflexively roll Resolve + Gnosis – the text creator’s Mind dots.

The new spirit begins at Rank 1 as one awoken with the Spirit 3 “Rouse Spirit” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 250), but rapidly grows in power, gaining one rank per day until it has rank (and all commensurate power) equal to its creator’s Mind dots.

The Abyss yawns wider with every passing year toward grim apocalypse or the final severance of the Supernal. It is no wonder that many mages look back wistfully on bygone ages when they did not merely nudge the vagaries of chance by tremulous degrees, but invoked the cosmos with brilliance and courage.</div><div>Even as magic withers, the works of man give more cause for despair. For every wizard who marvels at the technological triumphs of the 21 century, there are those who lament such ubiquitous power, bitterly wondering what value their hard-earned rotes hold when anyone might fly or speak to another across the expanse of continents or lay waste to nations with forces wrested from radiant ores. What was once wondrous has become commonplace, no longer a reward of singular genius and invincible will. Worst of all, these advances threaten magic itself by offering mages quick-and-dirty alternatives to their Arcana.</div><div>While such pessimistic elitism is not uncommon among mages, most eventually reconcile themselves with some facet of modernity, or else ennui consumes them utterly. Far fewer have the emotional fortitude to fully embrace the power and burden of the past, challenging perceived inconsequence by crafting their souls in the likeness of history’s echoes. As much antiques as antiquarians, history as historians, the Wraiths of Epochs have never found broad acceptance as a Legacy, though they are older than most traditions they preserve. From the Fall of Atlantis, they lingered among its ruins as living ghosts, anchoring themselves to the ideals of reminisced greatness. As history unfolded, they watched and remembered while the Abyss gnawed at the threads of human accomplishment and potential. The Wraiths of Epochs have become the self-appointed stewards of all things forgotten, waging an endless war to uncover what time erodes faster than time can destroy it. They do not accept that all good things pass, despite the grim preponderance of evidence to the contrary.</div><div>Despite their reputation, the Wraiths of Epochs do not reject technology out of ignorance or geriatric rigidity, and they aren’t inherently antagonistic to every invention on principle. Rather, their philosophy lays blame at the convenience of technology to distract mages from exploring their own power, thereby atrophying what magic remains in the world. Raised in an age of cell phones and rockets, most Wraiths fully comprehend the seductive lure of the modern. The Legacy draws new members from those willing to surrender conveniences for deeper truths. In the eyes of Wraith luminaries, mages unable or unwilling to make such ascetic sacrifices lack the devotion to advance in the Legacy’s mysteries.</div><div>Because of their myopic focus, the Wraiths of Epochs find few recruits. It is not enough that a potential Wraith be enamored of history, as so many mages are. A disciple must also reject the modern world so fiercely that he is willing to cut himself off from its advances. Such rejection can stem from disgust or horror or even an irresistible longing for a better and purer time. Whatever the motivation, candidates must endure extensive trials to test their commitment before a Wraith will help them craft their souls.</div><div>These tests begin simply enough, initially intended to inconvenience and annoy. If the candidate persists, successive trials gradually sever him from the aspects of modernity he most values. Only when a mage fully divests himself of distractions and embraces a lifestyle of contemplative isolation can he make the final sacrifice, forsaking future for past as he gives up happiness, prosperity and the comforting illusion that he matters in the grand design of the universe.</div><div>Within the mage community, Wraiths of Epochs generally go unnoticed unless someone wants to consult them on some aspect of the past or lure them out of passive research with the promise of new archeological finds. Although Wraiths seldom eschew politics entirely, having immersed themselves in enough cycles of civilization to recognize the dangers of total isolation, most find such endeavors distasteful as a matter of principle and prefer to hide behind heavy occultation and a reputation of disinterested neutrality whenever possible. The most politically active Wraiths work within the Mysterium to guide the order’s research toward the secrets of the past rather than contemporary lore. From an adversarial standpoint, Wraiths violently oppose the Cult of the Doomsday Clock (see Legacies: The Sublime, p. 128), whose calculated disruptions threaten the past as much as the future. The Ticktock men reciprocate this enmity, as Wraith Attainments can pierce the truth of destroyed time in ways most magic cannot.</div><div>Among Sleepers, Wraiths of Echoes who maintain visible mortal lives typically find work as teachers, librarians, museum curators and other specialized jobs at the fringes of academia, allowing Wraiths to disguise their anachronisms as perfectly “normal” behavior for their profession. Those who break ties with the human society live almost entirely beyond its needs and notice.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Before the Fall</h3><div>With an innate predilection for unraveling the secrets of the past, the Wraiths of Epochs were among the first mages to discover that the concept of “history” doesn’t readily apply to the time or world before the Fall of Atlantis. At the most basic level, Atlantean events cannot be dated in relation to the present, but the problem is more complicated than that. Atlantis is as much allegory as fact, based on intertwined cosmological precepts that defy logical analysis and creative interpretation. Those mages who have managed to obtain sufficient temporal sympathy from scavenged relics to glimpse anything of Atlantis have offered contradictory accounts as rich in obscure symbolism as most tangled enigmas of Temenos, filtered as they are through the cracked lens of imperfect Gnosis and Wisdom. While such extraordinary visions can offer valuable insights, they are ultimately shadows of a more perfect truth that no mage alive can or perhaps even should understand. Given the difficulty of uncovering a vision of Atlantis in the first place, Storytellers should certainly reward the effort, perhaps with clues buried in metaphor or Arcane Experience or both, but they should not feel obligated to offer any absolute truths on the most profound mysteries of the setting.</div>",

Any mage who dabbles in the Time Arcanum can glimpse the past; Wraiths of Epochs become the past with an awareness equally rooted in Death. They cannot escape the fact that everything they witness is gone and forever beyond reach, any more than they can escape the pitiless inevitability that time will destroy them, too. Each Attainment that follows reinforces and expands upon this core epiphany, opening the vast stretches of the past as the Wraith assumes the spectral mien from which the Legacy draws its name.</div><div>As powerful as these Attainments are, the Attainments of the Wraiths of Epochs come at a price; the process of becoming one with the past metaphysically diminishes their ties to the present. For each Attainment a Wraith learns, she suffers a cumulative –1 penalty to all Skill rolls to use modern technology, defined as anything invented within the past century or so (the span of an uninterrupted human life). The exact reach of this threshold is left deliberately blurry for Storytellers to enforce as appropriate to specific inventions. Even as the rate of technological process advances geometrically in the post-industrial world, this century mark remains constant, such that today’s Wraiths are significantly more out of touch than those who lived in centuries past. A Wraith would have no trouble wielding a flintlock rifle with Firearms or performing calculations with an abacus using Computer, but he would certainly have trouble wielding an assault rifle or researching on the Internet. This penalty also applies to all uses of the Time Arcanum to view or predict the future in any capacity.</div>",

In the case of locations, touching the ground suffices. Once sufficient contact is established, he performs an instant action and specifies a date and time relative to the present; no roll is required. He must have at least a Described temporal sympathy connection to the target date, either through the touched object or personal knowledge. If these conditions are met, then for as long as he continues to concentrate, he experiences the events of the target object’s past as if he cast the Time 2 “Postcognition” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 260) with successes equal to his Time dots. This effect bypasses the occlusion of the Time 4 “Erase History” spell (see Legacies: The Sublime, p. 133) unless that spell was cast by a mage with more dots of Time than the Wraith.</div><div>Unlike basic “Postcognition,” a Wraith can alternately choose to allow his vision to be guided by Fate rather than choosing a specific time, in which case he witnesses the most important event that took place in the object’s presence as decided by the Storyteller.</div><div>In addition to viewing fleeting glimpses of history, a Wraith also experiences the present through the inescapable lens of death. He cannot see a flower in a vase without knowing the bloom has already begun to wilt, and even the noonday sun radiates the dull red hues of its eventual expansion and demise. While much of this sensory alteration is purely cosmetic and a matter for Storyteller narration, such perception also duplicates all effects of the Death 1 “Grim Sight” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 134); this change is permanent and cannot be reversed.

        "descrizione": "<div>The Acanthus of the Adamantine Arrow are tacticians first and last, a natural extension of their prowess with analyzing probability and causality. Thus, they know that mages are in a treacherous position by dint of their numbers. The Awakened are rare, and it’s only because of their penchant for remaining hidden (and their power, obviously) that they survive. But what happens when the Seers of the Throne or Banishers, or some more esoteric enemy, attack and kill the Wise of a given area? The survivors have no way to shore up their numbers. They can’t make more mages.</div><div>The mages of the Awakening Gambit beg to differ. By analysis and careful manipulation, they say, it is possible to arrange a scenario in which a person must either Awaken or perish. These “Kingmakers” step in only if the target seems to be leaning more toward the “perish” option, but otherwise they welcome a new mage, a mage who is already suited by the circumstances of his Awakening to join the Arrow.</div><div>Obviously, this position is controversial. Manipulating a mortal’s fate this way can legitimately be viewed as a violation of the Lex Magica, and certainly as an act of hubris. Also, some mages see the Gambit’s strategy as trying to “cheat the system,” arranging false crises so that a mage’s soul is tricked into waking up. What kinds of mages are created from such situations, they wonder? Are these mages dishonest, perhaps with a penchant for underhanded manipulation themselves? Are the Kingmakers, in fact, making more mages like them?</div><div>Other mages, though, see the Kingmakers’ actions as perfectly viable. The Fallen World isn’t a product of magic, after all; it’s a product of the war between the Exarchs and the Oracles. Clearly, laws for Awakening exist, so why not exploit them? The concern isn’t one of ethics, but of efficacy — do the Gambit’s tactics work?</div><div>Whether or not they do (see the sidebar), the Awakening Gambit Legacy is tolerated and not viewed as left-handed for two reasons. First, the Kingmakers are planners and logicians without peer — they have to be, to do what they do — and that’s good for the order. Second, the Kingmakers have a reputation within the order as being good judges of character and highly moral in their own right (with respect to matters other than arranging people’s fates like pawns on a chessboard, that is). If the Gambit has an agenda beyond their stated one, they hide it extremely well.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>So, Does It Work?</h3><div>The data are inconclusive. It might work. Mages do seem to arise from the situations that the Gambit creates. But even then, are the Kingmakers putting people in situations in which they Awaken, or just choosing people who would have Awakened anyway and acting as the catalyst? Since conclusive data on the number of people who Awaken and under what circumstances aren’t really available, it’s hard to say if the Kingmakers’ actions really have the effect they want.</div><div>For purposes of your chronicle, the Storyteller doesn’t necessarily need to decide whether the Kingmakers’ methods work consistently. All she needs to decide is whether they work in any particular instance. The players — and their characters — can draw their own conclusions from there.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The World as a Chessboard</h3><div>The Awakening Gambit takes much of its inspiration, even its name, from the game of chess. Almost all members of the Legacy are avid players (and many also partake of other strategy games, such as Go and mah jong). In chess, the “gambit” is an opening strategy, one that usually involves a sacrifice for better position. The Kingmakers see what they do as a sacrifice — they are giving up their own time, their resources and, in some cases, their Wisdom (depending on their methods) for the chance to bring new mages into the fold.</div><div>Chess terminology permeates the Legacy, and the extended metaphor serves as the method for teaching new members. To the Gambit, the ability to keep a given strategy in mind while also looking after a score of pieces is paramount, because it is with just such complicated stratagems that they seek to Awaken new mages.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Making of Kings</h3><div>How do the Kingmakers go about arranging Awakenings? The process is a difficult one, and it’s by no means something the Kingmakers do constantly. They recognize that manipulating Destiny this way is dangerous, and so it’s usually only something they attempt when the numbers of mages in the area have fallen for some reason, or when the Arrow is expecting trouble in the near future. But the Gambit mages (sometimes in conjunction with Mysterium or Guardian cabals) keep tabs on Sleepers who would make good mages, and create several scenarios in which the Kingmakers could arrange an Middlegame (see below) should it become necessary.</div><div>The Kingmakers structure their scenarios on the game of chess. In the Opening, the Kingmakers choose their target and learn everything they can about her. Each Kingmaker has his own criteria for choosing, rejecting or accepting a potential mage. Some Kingmakers assume that people with families make the best mages, while other Kingmakers won’t even consider Sleepers with such firmly established ties to the mundane world. A Gambit mage might delve into a Sleeper’s family tree, looking for mages, while another looks only at her immediate circle of family and friends, searching for hints of the supernatural.</div><div>A crucial part of the Opening is exposure to magic. It’s a violation of the Lex Magica, yes, but the Gambit considers it paramount to test the target’s reaction to vulgar magic. The Kingmaker usually brings another member of the Legacy (or his cabal, if the members are sympathetic) to keep things from getting out of control, and chooses a vulgar spell that’s obviously magical but that isn’t going to kill anyone if it misfires (unless the Kingmaker is cocksure, which happens). The usual response is Disbelief, and the Gambit doesn’t consider anything wrong with that. Sometimes, though, a target meets vulgar magic with a different reaction — anger, curiosity, fear — and holds on to that feeling even after the memory has faded. Occasionally, the target seems to “feel” the magic coming before the spell goes off (in game terms, the mortal has the Unseen Sense Merit). Any abnormality is note and interpreted, but whether it cements the decision to continue the Gambit or is viewed as a “deal-breaker” depends on the mage in question.</div><div>Once the mage feels that he has enough information on the target (which can take months or more), he makes a decision: to press on with the Gambit, to reject the Sleeper outright or to “shelve” the Sleeper against a time when she might be more suitable to the Gambit (or the Gambit has need of her).</div><div>If the mage decides to press on, the Gambit enters the Middlegame. In this stage, the Kingmaker crafts a scenario precisely designed to play to the person’s strengths and weaknesses in an attempt to back the target into a corner. The target, ideally, has only two choices: Awaken or die.</div><div>The Middlegame always involves some crisis, but the varieties are limitless. Some Kingmakers prefer to isolate their targets, because it’s easier to arrange things without too many other conflicting factors. Others feel that having large numbers of Sleepers around makes for more powerful and capable mages should the Awakening “take.” The Awakening Gambit views Sleepers involved in a target’s Middlegame as “pawns.” Sleepwalkers are called “bishops” or “rooks” depending on what role they are to play, while mages (or other supernatural beings) who are unaware of what’s going on are called “knights.” A mage (or, potentially, another supernatural being) who is aware of the Kingmaker’s plan and is willingly helping is a “queen.” The “king,” of course, is the target herself. These terms are just shorthand that the Kingmakers use when setting up the scenario. Once the mage figures out exactly what role a given “piece” needs to play, he refers to her by a name rather than the title.</div><div>The Middlegame is planned as meticulously as possible, leaving as little to chance as the Kingmaker can manage. Mages with proficiency in Mind as well as Fate often do a “dry run” in their own dreams, trying to account for the variables of the situation and identify any variables that they are missing. In the end, though, it’s impossible to take everything into account, and so expecting the unexpected is crucial to the Kingmakers’ work.</div><div>One facet of the Gambit that the mage always spends time on is the Failsafe. The Failsafe is the mage’s strategy for extraction — saving the Sleeper’s life should she fail to Awaken or otherwise save herself. This might involve setting up a portal with the Space Arcanum or preparing a powerful healing spell (or both), depending on the capabilities of the mage and what he expects to happen.</div><div>Before putting the Middlegame into effect, the Kingmaker and any knowing allies he enlists spend time in meditation before beginning. This meditation is meant to put the Kingmaker’s intentions in the right place, and hopefully ensure that they will have the purity of heart to see it through (see p. 51 of the World of Darkness Rulebook for more on meditation and its game effects). When the Middlegame begins, the rest is in the target’s hands. The resolution — the Endgame — is one of three possibilities.The simplest is that something goes wrong, some unforeseen occurrence that the mage cannot control or mitigate. The mage aborts and takes the Middlegame back to the drawing board (and always spends time in deep analysis to make sure that whatever interfered wasn’t the result of someone else, such as the Seers of the Throne, taking a hand).</div><div>The desirable outcome, of course, is for the target to Awaken. In this case, the mage allows the target to handle as much of the crisis as she can, but does step in to prevent death and destruction as necessary. The new mage is then welcomed to the Awakened community, and is expected (though not technically required) to join the Adamantine Arrow.</div><div>Finally, the target might fail to Awaken. The Failsafe is put into effect, and hopefully the Kingmaker saves the Sleeper’s life and the lives of those around her. The target is watched sporadically afterwards, in case she should Awaken later, but for the most part, the experience is chalked up to learning, and the Kingmaker looks for a new potential mage.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Examples</h3><div>A single father of two comes to the attention of a Kingmaker, who feels that despite his heavy responsibilities (or rather, because of them) he would make a good recruit. Since the focus of his life is his children, the Kingmaker decides to use them in the Middlegame. He entices the kids to get on the wrong bus one day on the way home, and watches the man’s panic as he can’t find his children.</div><div>He does the sensible thing — notify the police — but that’s not enough for him. He starts an in-depth search of the area where his kids were last seen, talks to people, pays for information from some passersby and works his way closer to his kids. The children, meanwhile, have been shunted from place to place all day courtesy of the Kingmaker’s magic (but kept safe all the while). The Middlegame is a race — can the man get his kids back before they step off the last bus, miles away from anywhere they recognize? The father finds himself wandering amidst a gleaming set of iron towers, but can see the threads that lead him directly through the maze to what he loves most, his family. He Awakens as a Mastigos, and the Kingmaker is there to welcome the new mage.</div><div>An EMT has been taking note of odd emergencies in the city for some time, but does not realize they are largely the result of extended conflict between warring Awakened factions. The Kingmakers, hurting from a recent assault from the Seers of the Throne, decide to try to Awaken her. Calling upon intelligence about the Seers, the Kingmakers arrange to attack a lone (but powerful) enemy, and influence a Sleeper witness to call for an ambulance. The EMT arrives and witnesses the Kingmaker and the Seer casting spells, but is unable to resist the Disbelief — instead, she “merely” does her job, patching up the wounded.</div><div>She demonstrates courage in the face of danger but does not Awaken. The Kingmakers might consider making an ally of her in another capacity, but they write off this Middlegame as a failure. A Sleeper occultist has amassed a collection of magical tomes, and has cross-referenced the information there well enough to see some Supernal correspondences. The Kingmakers figure that it’s only a matter of time until he Awakens anyway, and decide to give him a boost. They arrange for him to be invited to an auction at which several rare books are being sold, one of which is a “plant,” created by an allied cabal and containing dangerous spirit-summoning spells.</div><div>When the auctioneer opens the book, the spirits are released and run amok (but are not powerful enough to do anything but frighten people). The occultist hides under a table, whimpering, and the Kingmakers put the Failsafe into effect — speaking a trigger phrase, they banish the spirits and wait for Disbelief to kick in. They might later “liberate” a few of the occult books from this man’s collection, since he’s obviously not going to be using them anytime soon.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Gambit and Wisdom</h3><div>The Awakening Gambit does not, in itself, cause degeneration. What a given Kingmaker does during the Gambit, though, very well might. If anyone dies, a degeneration check is required as though the mage had used magic to kill a human being, regardless of how the victim actually died. Mentally coercing pawns and other “pieces” for the Middlegame might cause degeneration, depending on how the mage goes about it.</div>",

        "orders": "The Awakening Gambit is exclusively Adamantine Arrow, but the other orders might become involved with the Gambit occasionally. The Mysterium regards the Gambit as a fascinating experiment, and potentially enlightening about the nature of the Awakening. Therefore, Mysterium mages often wind up as queens or rooks in the Gambit’s endeavors, provided they are allowed the chance to interview any successfully Awakened targets.<div>The Silver Ladder and the Free Council, perhaps surprisingly, have similar reactions to the Gambit. Namely, they either applaud the Legacy’s efforts in trying to codify the Awakening, or they damn the Kingmakers as meddlers and manipulators. Often, whichever attitude one order takes, the other order takes the opposite.</div><div>The Guardians of the Veil, of course, take an extremely dim view of the Awakening Gambit. People Awaken when they are meant to, and forcing the issue doesn’t lead to anything but risk for all involved. It is rumored, though, that the Guardians teach an analogous Legacy to their own Tricksters, and that their gambits are subtle enough to put those of the Arrow to shame. Indeed, Arrows of the Legacy sometimes joke that the whole Awakening Gambit is merely part of a larger Middlegame dreamed up by the Guardians.</div>",

This isn’t necessarily out of egomania; more than one Kingmaker has made a friend of a courageous, honest and forthright Sleeper and wished desperately to be able to bring him into the fold as one of the Wise, for his own benefit and that of the Consilium.<div>Young and inexperienced mages aren’t usually told about the Gambit, and even if they learn about it, they aren’t usually afforded the chance to join. Aside from the fairly stringent magical requirements (see “Attainments”), the kind of work that the Kingmakers do is based on life experience and, more specifically, life experience as a mage. Until an Arrow has a few years with a cabal under her belt, dealing directly with other mages and seeing the kinds of qualities that go into being successful among the Awakened, she probably has no business with the Gambit.</div>",
        "organizzation": "Not every Consilium boasts the presence of the Kingmakers, but those that do tend to have more than one. The Middlegame is much easier to arrange and execute with assistance, and so when a Kingmaker takes a pupil, she usually does so with the assumption that the pupil is going to stay in the area and help her. It’s also not uncommon for Kingmakers to receive requests from nearby cities (and “nearby” is relative) to come and assist with a Gambit, so the Legacy’s members keep informal contact with each other.<div>All Kingmakers are expected to be active members of the Adamantine Arrow. Loners and curmudgeons need not apply — the Awakening Gambit isn’t necessarily friendly, but it is social. Teachers and pupils often live together during the initial training sessions, and even after the pupil has officially joined the Legacy, his lessons in evaluating Sleepers and constructing the Middlegame continue. The Legacy is therefore a tight-knit fraternity (one of the reasons that it survives despite concerns about its ethics and efficacy).</div>",

What effect this has on the target’s behavior is largely a matter for the Storyteller (probably with input from the player), but the Kingmakers usually use this Attainment to clear away uninvolved parties or to nudge pawns in the appropriate directions. A sudden compulsion to get a cheeseburger can make a pawn turn left (toward the restaurant) at the corner, instead of right, and that might make all the difference.</div><div>When this Attainment is used against mages or other supernatural beings, or when the mage tries to influence behavior more directly, the player must roll Manipulation + Persuasion + Mind (minus the target’s Resolve + Gnosis). If this roll succeeds, the mage can implant a single, one-phrase suggestion (for a Sleeper) or affect the target’s emotions as described above (for supernatural beings). The point of Mana is still required, however.</div>",

This effect is similar to the Time 3 spell “Shifting Sands,” and allows the mage to rewind time back to his last action. From there, the mage can take a different action and hopefully avoid whatever unpleasantness time has in store for him (but all else being equal, the other people involved still take the same actions, so he needs to make his action count). The player simply spends a point of Mana to activate the effect. Using this Attainment more than once on the same action (that is, rewinding time more than once trying to get the desired result) is possible, but expensive — the Mana cost increases by 1 each time. The second time the mage rewinds time for the same action, it costs two Mana, then three and so on.",

The most powerful, however, seem to be working on dozens of possibilities at once, keeping multiple dangers from becoming catastrophes and waiting for the perfect moment to begin the Endgame. Grandmaster’s View allows this kind of precision.</div><div>This Attainment is somewhat similar to the Mind 4 spell “Supreme Augmentation” (p. 216 of Mage: The Awakening), but it does not by itself allow the mage to raise Attributes. Instead, it provides a kind of mental simulator, allowing the mage to consider the ramifications of his actions before he takes them.</div><div>In game terms, the mage is always considered to have the highest initiative in a conflict, his Defense does not decrease due to attacks from multiple opponents (see p. 156 of the World of Darkness Rulebook) and he applies his Defense against all ranged attacks.</div><div>Outside combat, though, the mage can also take advantage of the Attainment. He can take up to four non-Physical actions in a single turn. For instance, he can try to remember a fact, plan a route through the city, read a book and listen for an approaching car at the same time. He must be physically capable of performing both actions at once — that is, if he’s already explaining a concept to someone, he can’t be simultaneously trying to persuade someone else to help him.

The player spends one point of Mana and rolls Intelligence + Wits + Time. If this roll succeeds, the mage chooses a number of actions equal to his Time dots, and can try them out in succession. This Attainment works in or out of combat, but determining causality is more difficult the more time elapses from his action. Also, keeping control of the time stream grows progressively difficult. For every action the mage undertakes, the player must roll Resolve + Composure. If this roll succeeds, the mage maintains control and can simply observe what future this action leads to. If this roll fails, though, the mage’s focus slips, and the action he’s currently view actually happens, becoming reality. The mage can try to pull it back using the second Attainment’s optional Arcanum power, but doing so requires a roll of Manipulation + Wits with a negative modifier equal to the number of actions that the mage has already viewed.  </div><div><i>Example: A Middlegame has become rather more violent than Fisher was expecting. The target is surrounded by thugs, several of whom are pawns of a local vampire lord, and Fisher knows that if he doesn’t step in, his target is going to die. Fisher activates his Attainment and chooses four actions (since Fisher is an Adept of Time). For the first possibility, Fisher casts Chronos’s Curse on the thugs, hoping to slow them enough for his target to escape. The player makes the roll for the spell, Paradox and all, and it turns out that this spell fails — obviously that’s not a good option. The player rolls Resolve + Composure and succeeds, so Fisher can continue looking.</i> </div><div><i>For the second possibility, Fisher shoots one of the thugs in the leg and yells for the others to stand down. This requires an Intimidation roll, which Fisher’s player succeeds in making — the thugs back off, but don’t leave. Better, but still not ideal. The player rolls Resolve + Composure, and succeeds again.</i> </div><div><i>For the third potential action, Fisher turns to his expertise in Mind, and tries to mentally control the thugs. He succeeds in doing so and orders them to flee the area, though one of them manages to shake off the spell before he gets too far away. The player rolls Resolve + Composure, but fails the roll — Fisher’s focus slips, and this action is the one that he truly takes. Unless Fisher wishes to activate the Time version of the Mysterious Rook Attainment (see above), he’ll have to deal with the remaining thug. If Fisher does wish to do this, his player will need to roll Manipulation + Wits with a –3 modifier (since Fisher viewed three possible futures) for the Attainment to work.</i></div>"

        "descrizione": "<div>It begins in the early 17th century, with a masterless man. His birth name has been lost to history and he is now known only by his shadow name, Hagetaka (“Vulture.”) The circumstances of his life before the Awakening are lost to history, though his writings obliquely suggest that he became a bandit and assassin after his lord was slain through treachery. Interestingly, Hagetaka never writes of his Awakening, and makes many assumptions about the reader’s understanding of the events of his life before his lord’s murder. Most modern onikaze swordsmen consider this assumption of familiarity to be subtle Mastigos underhandedness at work, and some wonder if there really ever was an Awakened fallen samurai who went by the moniker “Hagetaka.”</div><div>Whatever the case, the Legacy’s texts tell of Hagetaka’s aimless wanderings, of a lack of focus and discipline and the elusive sense that something moved just beyond the brigand’s perceptions. Balancing serene meditations with a life of violent crime, Hagetaka eventually came to a “place of visions,” whereupon he experienced within a deep trance a sort of communion with what he called “the restless ghost of a great dragon of the western seas.” The substance of his exchange with this “dragon” is recorded only as a series of 98 mutually-contradictory koans (36 of which have never been satisfactorily deciphered by any practitioner of the Legacy), but he came away with two things: the desire to offer the Adamantine Arrow the benefit of his experiences as a man of honor and a man without, and an awareness of what he called the onikaze: the “demon wind,” which transcended space and time.</div><div>The writings of Hagetaka thereafter chronicle his self-appointed quest to assemble those that might apprehend the vision revealed to him by the dragon. He fought many great warriors and conversed with many sages of martial philosophy, converted no few to his cause. All of these, Hagetaka eventually brought to an isolated and abandoned temple somewhere in the mountains. The place lay in ruins, and the first onikaze swordsman made his disciples work to restore it, forbidding them the use of their magics and instead commanding them to work with their own hands and minds, even as he imparted upon them — some nine students in all — the secrets of the demon wind. The morning after they had finally completed the years-long work of restoring the temple, Hagetaka’s students awoke to discover their master gone, with kanji inscribed into the cobbles of the courtyard: “These are merely stones, and the wind ceases its motion for no man. Your hands, your wills, your selves: you need nothing more.”</div><div>To a man, Hagetaka’s students left behind the product of their long labors, going out into the world to put into practice the training that they had been given. Some become great heroes and others, villains, but all took on students of their own, and, in time, the Wave-men as a whole were gradually adopted into the Adamantine Arrow, leaving only a scattered few to carry the philosophy in other directions. Legends tell that the Wave-men periodically gathered at Hagetaka’s temple thereafter, to address matters of great importance to the entire Legacy, but the records of such gatherings are few and considered by most to be largely apocryphal. In modern times, the location of the temple — if, indeed, it ever truly existed at all — is lost to the Brotherhood, and most agree that such is for the best. While reverence for the past can be a source of strength and wisdom, it is also attachment, and the way of the Wave-man denies such fetters. As Hagetaka himself said, “These are merely stones…”</div><div>Spreading across the world at the forefront of the wind from which they take their name, the warriors of the onikaze are wanderers, fighting for the causes that appeal to them or sometimes just those that pay. Some embrace the romance of the samurai and defend the weak and downtrodden, setting their blades against wickedness and tyranny. Others, perhaps more practical, sell their services — either as swordsmen or as teachers of the martial arts — to those who can afford them. A rare few even manage to carve out places for themselves and obtain positions of power and respect in established Consilii. Most, however, spend at least some part of their lives as lonely pilgrims, moving from place to place, upon musha shugyo, in an endless pursuit of the perfection of the blade.</div><div>Interestingly, while the Wave-men have always been relatively few, their numbers have survived the trials of time relatively undiminished by various wars and calamities. The very wanderlust that motivates their many quests and keeps them scattered has served to protect them from ordeals that might have grievously wounded or even exterminated a more close-knit Legacy. Thus, while they shall forever remain but few, it is likely that the swordsmen of the onikaze will always be out there, in one way or another.</div>",

        "orders": "",
        "appearance": "While the image of the street samurai is a perennial favorite among fans of anime — in Japan and in the West — most onikaze swordsmen eschew such trappings, preferring a more practical aesthetic. Since the majority of Wave-men barely manage to get by, their clothing tends to be sturdy and utilitarian; one never knows when a chance to replace a damaged garment will present itself. Denim jeans, heavy boots, leather coats and the like are among the more common wardrobe choices for Brothers of the Demon Wind, as these articles stand up well to a variety of environments and can last for years, if properly cared for. Body decoration, of whatever sort, is frowned upon, and hair tends to either be close-cropped, or even shaved or else worn long, sometimes in elaborate tails, braids or buns.<div>Every warrior of the onikaze owns a daisho, the paired long and short swords of the samurai. These weapons are treated with the utmost reverence, for they are a reflection of the mage’s honor and the vessel of his spirit. The various components that comprise the matched set of katana and wakazashi may be austere or elaborate in design, as befits the personality of their wielder (or that of the mentor who handed them down.) Most Wave-men carry these weapons at any formal Awakened function, and some with especially refined powers of misdirection or occlusion are known to carry them at all times.</div>",
        "background": "Wave-men are drawn from the ranks of the most skilled swordsmen that prospective onikaze mentors can find. Some look for philosophical warriorsages and others for obsessive perfectionists, but there are some who will settle for a bullying thug whose only skill of note is the ability to kill three men in as many seconds with a sword. Discipline, such would-be teachers reason, can be taught with time and harsh lessons, while the art of the blade is a study of an entire lifetime. Of note is the fact that many Wave-men flatly refuse to adopt women into the Legacy. To these sorts, the study of kenjutsu is men’s work, not to be entrusted to a woman. This attitude is gradually subsiding with time, though particularly old (or especially hidebound) onikaze swordsmen look upon female practitioners of the Legacy with attitudes ranging from outrage to disgust to outright anger (sometimes expressed with drawn swords.) Even many of the more progressive Wave-men still find themselves looking twice upon first meeting a female Disciple of the Demon Wind — out of unfamiliarity with the notion, if nothing else.",

Anything more would be impractical at best. That said, the master-apprentice bond is often a powerful one for the swordsmen of the onikaze. In some cases, this relationship is one of antagonism, as the teacher attempts to spur the student onward to excellence through an adversarial stance. Other masters adopt a paternal (or, rarely, maternal) method, acting the part of a stern but caring parent. However they do it, though, the master is urged, by his training and by his peers, to instill in the student a sense of self-reliance and adaptability. Indeed, many warriors of the onikaze go years or even decades without setting eyes on another of their Legacy, for the Demon Wind scatters them far and wide, so that their blades might be brought to bear where they are needed most.",

        "descrizione": "<div>So many modern Awakened choose to see the Atlantean Dragon as a symbol of nobility and honor, a creature of elevated principles, paragon of a grand civilization. But the truth of the matter is that the dragon is, at its core, a symbol of rage and terror. Indeed, in many ancient cultures, “dragon” is essentially synonymous with “monster” or “devil,” the embodiment of a savage and primordial hatred and hunger. So it is with those who walk the path of the Devourer, consuming the enemies of lost Atlantis and supping upon their power in the name of a greater good. But men are not meant to be as dragons, and so these practitioners of a law as timeless as it is inhuman have strayed far from the path of Wisdom, battening them upon hubris as surely as if it were the sweetest of marrow. </div><div>The Devourers of the Flesh are keepers of an old Legacy, one that they believe to dates back to the time before the Fall. While there exists no evidence to support such claims, there certainly is something primal and ancient in their hunger for the flesh, the atavistic urge toward a longing (or perhaps a need) forbidden by civilized traditions and Supernal commandments. Perhaps this age-old practice is reflected in many of the world’s cannibalistic warrior cultures, whose beliefs are echoed and magnified in the brutal Devourers: in a very real way consuming the enemy’s heart to take his strengths into oneself. </div><div>The practitioners of this Legacy claim to have been advance scouts and shock troops for Atlantis, going among the enemy’s ranks and sowing the sort of terror that arises only from finding the half-eaten carcasses of one’s people strewn between trees and over stones, glyphs of ill-omen painted in their congealing blood. While other Awakened who hear of this tale dismiss it as the self-serving propaganda of a fellowship of anthropophagic monstrosities, the Devourers wonder at the naiveté of those who can earnestly believe any truly great and powerful civilization of remote and ancient times to have balked at such practices in a world in which people were not so thoroughly conditioned to fear their own instincts. By stealing the power of Atlantis’s enemies of old, the Devourers say, their spiritual forebears performed a service as vital as and, ultimately, far more natural than that practiced by the priests who read the stars or the scholars who kept the cavernous libraries of the island empire. </div><div>The so-called Cannibals (a title to which the Legacy’s practitioners attach no sense of shame) consider themselves to be inheritors of a purer ethic than is found in the modern world. Just as every predator in nature hunts that which best sustains the predator and helps it to grow strong, so, too, do the Devourers allege that they consume the prey who empowers and uplifts them. Naturally, those who interact in any way with Awakened (or even just Sleeper) society must invariably attempt to conceal their practices, but this becomes increasingly difficult for most Devourers as time passes, Wisdom withers and dies and the willworker asks himself why it is that he hides his splendor from lesser beasts. Beyond such a point, these mages are already too far gone to salvage (if, indeed, one can consider redemption to be possible in the first place for a person who incorporates the consumption of his own kind into his very soul), and must be destroyed for the good of their world. Of course, some manage to escape, fleeing into the wilds — or perhaps just the most savage depths of the urban wilderness — there to perpetuate their philosophy of hunger. </div><div>Long considered to be a blight upon the otherwise upright reputation of the Adamantine Arrow, the Devourers of the Flesh have managed, nevertheless, to persist for at least centuries (and, quite possibly, far longer) without being utterly stamped out. The Legacy is laid low in one place, only to emerge elsewhere later, proving as persistent and resilient as the predators from which it derives its ghastly mandate. And, despite the reflexive fear and hatred of their fellow Arrows, Cannibals in the order continue to take their oaths to the Adamantine Arrow quite seriously. Indeed, many see themselves as the only true champions of the Adamantine Arrow’s cause, imitating the dragon of old and consuming the power of Atlantis’s enemies by fang and claw. Devourers don’t tend to be impressive strategists, but they are certainly terrifying to behold on the battlefield, with the eldest and most potent dominating the engagement, lips and chins slick with hot blood, and the trophies of scores of kills dangling from hair, flesh and hand-sewn clothing alike.</div>",

A few break these stereotypes, but the degeneration of Wisdom that goes hand-in-hand with the Cannibals’ philosophy often outwardly expresses itself as a denial of contemporary human dress and custom. Paradox Brands tends to be common among Cannibals, and they usually take on animalistic features: all the better with which to hunt and consume their prey.",

Perhaps, in older days, the cannibalistic societies of the world produced such willworkers on some kind of consistent basis, but that age is now gone.

While Devourers may occasionally enjoy a shared hunt, however, only rarely do they run together for any length of time. When they do, they tend to form small, tight-knit cabals that leave death — and perhaps a new convert or two — in their wake, before either disbanding or else being put down. Rumors persist, though, of a handful of Cannibal cabals that thrive in the isolated parts of the Fallen World, the sorts of places in which conflict and hard living make for particularly strong specimens, and where no one thinks twice when people go missing and never turn up again.",

Many sources have named him, but all these names are known by his descendents to be falsehoods, meant to lead outsiders astray, for the practitioners of this dark and hazardous species of goetia are ill-understood by many and often vilified for their thankless work. They treat with demons, after all, and hold themselves to be nobles among the nightmares that haunt the Realm of Scourging, from which, the self-proclaimed “Diabolists” maintain, the incarnations of Vice emanate. </div><div>The lore of the Bene Ashmedai recounts the torments of the infernal sovereign, Asmodai, shackled to the will of Solomon the sorcerer-king. That lore tells, too, of the many long journeys of Solomon and his periods of scholarly seclusion, during which the nameless apprentice stole into the chamber in which Asmodai was imprisoned. A heathen by birth, he was not bound by the Hebrews’ religious law, and so sought to truly comprehend the terrible spirit his king had subjugated. Upon the occasion of the Sabaean’s first visit, Asmodai, enraged at the youth’s presumption, roared and bellowed and displayed many fearsome magics, but the intruder was unmoved. Instead, he asked, simply and without guile what was the source of the demon’s great anger. At this, Asmodai’s fury abated, for it came to understand this was no errand boy sent with chores from Solomon, nor some curious spectator hoping merely to gawk at the spirit in chains. </div><div>“Return to me at the next darkening of the moon,” Asmodai replied, “and you shall have your answer.” </div><div>So began the instruction that, the Bene Ashmedai claim, laid the foundations of their Legacy. While Solomon toiled away at the staid lore of locking away his human nature, his apprentice studied in secret the arts of wresting self-mastery out of the gilded talons of indulgence. Sometimes the Warlock was educated through unearthly delights and, at other times, unimaginable torments. Eventually, however, Asmodai became concerned that the king suspected its rebellious behavior and bade the apprentice to flee Israel, taking with him all he had learned. When the young man expressed sincere concern for his mentor’s fate, the demon smiled. “We are not born of men; our flesh is not your flesh. And yet, I see in you a spirit like my own, and so I name you an heir to my kingdom, shattered and incomplete. Go forth, my child, to preserve what I have shown you. In time, Solomon will be dust and my freedom returned to me. A human lifetime of ignominy I endure happily should my teachings survive. You are now a prince amongst demons.” </div><div>The legends of the Diabolists go on to recount the travels of the nameless apprentice, as well as the many adventures of his nine students. None, though, could draw the secrets Asmodai gave freely into themselves as Solomon did with those he stole. Generation upon generation, as centuries turned into millennia, they handed down their demonic sorcery, and many grew powerful in such magics, though none learned to master them. Interestingly, it was one of the heirs to Solomon’s teachings, the willworkers known as the Clavicularius, in whom Asmodai’s sorcery came into fullest flower. </div><div>The year was 5490 by the reckoning of the Hebrew calendar — 1730 to those who held to Gregory’s count of years — when a Clavicularius by the Shadow Name of Ahab chanced upon a handful of the surviving disciples of the nameless Sabaean in North Africa. Upon first encountering these willworkers, Ahab’s wrath was vast, and he resolved to destroy them and their heretical knowledge. While he went with murderous intent into the sanctum of those he most despised, the willworker emerged from that hidden place wise in the sorcery of Asmodai, and calling himself Ba’al Hammon. To this day, none know for certain how it was that Ahab abandoned one Legacy for another; the Clavicularius claim he did so only through infernal magics, while the Bene Ashmedai maintain he was enlightened through his exposure to the demon’s teachings. </div><div>Almost immediately, Ba’al Hammon set out to ingratiate himself with the local powers within the Vox Draconis, to counter the inevitable backlash from those he had betrayed. His ploy earned the Warlock the protection of the Hierarch, who became one of his first students. Ba’al Hammon was a prolific teacher, and he demanded that each of his apprentices adopt similar practices, until such a time as the numbers of what he came to call the Bene Ashmedai — the Children of Asmodai — were strong enough both to weather the enmity of the first Diabolist’s former Legacy and to have something of substance to offer the Silver Ladder as an order. To counter the natural (and dangerous) desires engendered by such close communion with the demon within, Ba’al Hammon set forth an unyielding policy of service for his disciples: through indulgence, they would make of Asmodai’s lessons a beacon by which to light the way for the long, dark journey of the human soul. </div><div>On account of their founder’s capable scheming, as well as not a little bit of luck, the Bene Ashmedai survived their tumultuous foundation and prospered within the Vox Draconis unto the modern day. Though ever few, their great ambition, married to their humble mandate, serves them well within their adoptive order, and so the Diabolists continue to seek the lofty heights of the Supernal at the end of the long road of excess.</div>",

In both cases, they take well to the limelight and many are natural leaders. By nature, Diabolists are usually better at inspiring others than they are at developing strategies, and so they tend to become influential demagogues rather than effective bureaucrats.

Because the Diabolists are often confused with Left-Handed mages by the ignorant, they avoid any large-scale organization, preferring instead to work in ones and twos, occasionally swapping stories, advice and new magics when they happen to encounter one another, whether in the world of flesh or in the realms of the mind and the spirit.",

Perhaps it was in that age the Keepers of the Covenant first came to be, bridging the gap between mortal men and the gods who walked, unseen, throughout the world. Certainly there are none alive today who can point to the origin of the Legacy. Because of this, and because of their inextricable ties to the animistic and primordial Shadow, these willworkers know themselves as “Elders,” and even to those who doubt the antiquity of their pedigree these mages often seem to possess old souls and they certainly wield old knowledge.</div><div>Strangely, even the Elders themselves are uncertain as to the specific nature of the “covenant” described by the title of their Legacy; most of their lore, however, indicates it refers to the secrets of their Attainments, passed down to mortal willworkers by entities of the Shadow Realm.</div><div>Ancient records within the Silver Ladder tell of feats like those performed by the Keepers of the Covenant, often far outside the lands considered “civilized” by city-dwellers. The Elders consider this to be evidence of the venerable age of their Legacy, as the majority of them have ever been far more at home in the wild places than among the works of men. As with the mages described in those old tales, the Keepers walk within the material and unseen worlds with equal facility, developing strange magics of Shadow and commanding the services of the spirits to be found there. Leaders and mystics among their people, as well as bastions of tradition and aspirants to the grandeur of the Supernal, they embody the primal majesty of the invisible world, tying their own destinies forever to that other plane.</div><div>But human beings — both Sleeper and Awakened — fear the things they do not understand, and the Keepers of the Covenant often became scapegoats for those of differing faiths. Their ways were labeled “unclean” and they were suspected of consorting with demons and other, far fouler things. The explosive spread of monotheistic religions, particularly Christianity, was the most grievous blow to be dealt to the Elders, whose membership was almost exclusively drawn from among peoples practicing a considerably different sort of relationship with the spiritual world. Before then, Keepers were often able to bring feuding parties to an equitable compromise; in the shadow of the Cross, however, when conversion by the sword became an acceptable practice, their magics were dealt with as unpardonable sins. Almost without exception, wherever the newcomers spread, the Elders of those regions came to seek out the théarchs among their would-be saviors. While many Keepers were by that time Apostates or adherents to other orders, the majority remained faithful to the Vox Draconis, and they sued for peace on those grounds.</div><div>Some Elders found their entreaties fell on deaf ears, but the majority reestablished common ground with their brethren in the Silver Ladder. Though these alliances often did little to save the cultures from which those Keepers came, they did manage to preserve the Legacy itself and the secrets of the Keepers passed, perhaps for the first time, into the urban centers of Europe, North Africa and the Near and Middle East. As the great religious conflicts of the first millennium spilled into the second and time marched, mercilessly, onward, théarchs were among those who sought out new lands. Some were deeply surprised to find Keepers of the Covenant scattered here and there among the indigenous peoples they encountered. The lore of these Elders, too, was incorporated into the knowledge the Vox Draconis had amassed, and many Keepers celebrated to learn their kin were to be found in every corner of the world. The oppression, exploitation and slow decimation of the majority of the civilizations in which these Elders thrived made this joy bittersweet at best, but, again, the beliefs and esoteric magics of the Legacy survived.</div><div>The stories told among the Keepers of the Covenant regarding the latter half of the second millennium are bleak: great leaders and magnificent societies laid low by disease, treachery and violence; persecution and enslavement; the slow eradication of ancient faiths. Some Elders stood their ground and perished, while others vanished into Shadow (sometimes with a handful of their people) and were never seen again by mortal eyes. For those who learned, however grudgingly, to assimilate, ignominy was their inheritance. Once proud and admired for their facility with the ways of Shadow, they became curiosities at best, and, at worst, objects of scrutiny, scorn and even hatred. For centuries, their numbers — never all that many to begin with — steadily declined, and the Keepers of the Covenant seemed doomed to extinction, their secrets to be forever lost to the Silver Ladder and to the Fallen World.</div><div>Modern accounts of the gathering that brought about a revival of the Elders in the early 20th century are both sparse and convoluted. Indeed, most such stories are mutually  contradictory. The rare few scholars within the Ladder who’ve studied them to any degree note that the tales seem to be deliberately labyrinthine, so as to eliminate any possibility of piecing together the truth. On only one premise do they agree: a handful of Keepers from around the world, none of whom had ever met, contacted one another to assemble a Great Council and discuss the future of the Legacy, and the majority of Elders were somehow convinced to attend. Some records indicate a grand ritual was conducted, rearranging the skein of fate to perpetuate the Keepers of the Covenant. Others say the most skilled and powerful of the Elders all resolved to take on apprentices, regardless of their personal wishes, so that the Legacy’s secrets would live on. Still others recount dire pacts with spirits, mysterious omens and the invocation of long-forgotten magics. Whatever the case, the Keepers of the Covenant enjoyed a resurgence, a movement aided only by the fits and starts with which the Western world gradually discovered scientific, scholarly and, every so often, spiritual interest in the values and practices of “traditional” societies. Still by no means numerous, the Elders’ numbers stand stronger in this day and age than they have for many years. Deep divisions and lingering wounds still hold some of them apart from their brothers and sisters in the Silver Ladder, but the majority of Keepers are content to enjoy this time of growth and renewal.</div>",

The only exception to this loose and informal contact is during the Legacy’s yearly Conclave. Held in a different city each year, this Conclave is a chance for members to meet, for individuals who wish to become members to attempt to convince an Animist to teach them, and for the various Animists to show off the various spirits with which they are working.</div><div>With an atmosphere somewhere between an academic conference, a high-end craft fair and a dog-show, Conclaves are chaotic events wherein members report about interesting or unusual applications of their abilities. The most chaotic and prestigious part of the Conclave consists of the more experienced members showing off objects whose spirits they have awakened using their version of the “Rouse Spirit” ability. In addition, Animists also discuss and demonstrate ways they have found to be able to work in tandem with their spirits. As noted, the Conclave is also where prospective members can attempt to convince an Animist to teach them. This in-person contact is crucial, because many Animists decide whether those prospective members are worthy to join this Legacy by watching them interact with the objects around them.</div>",

The members of this Legacy, often referred to as Blue Bloods, firmly agree with these traditions. They use their knowledge of this path to power to transform themselves into exceptional physical and mental specimens. These mages are healthier, faster, longer-lived and brighter than ordinary mortals. They become physical and mental paragons who consider themselves above the ordinary ranks of humanity. The fact that most of them live as much as a century longer than ordinary mortals only serves to help maintain the distance between them and others.<p>The Pure Sovereigns prefer to socialize with their own kind or with other mages who have also learned to master their bodies and minds. Most of the Pure Sovereigns consider both Sleepers and mages incapable of these feats to be somewhat inferior beings. In addition to not regarding other, less perfect individuals as equals, many of the Pure Sovereigns also consider themselves to be the rightful rulers of these “lesser beings.” To many outsiders, the Pure Sovereigns seem haughty and self-obsessed. However, it is also true that Blue Bloods who devote themselves to the study of this Legacy are physically and mentally superior to those around them. They remain in perfect health while those around them become ill, can easily make calm small talk with a hated enemy and fool almost all lie detectors. Moreover, they can accomplish all this with little or no effort on their part.</p><p>Some use their physical and mental prowess to become extreme hedonists who need never worry about hangovers, diseases or excessive fatigue. However, these Blue Bloods are rare exceptions who are often regarded as failures by their fellows. Most are passionately dedicated to accomplishing some goal and simply wish to avoid having their bodies or their minds interfere in any way with their ability to succeed.</p>",

Close-fitting, designer athletic gear is common attire for both male and female members of this Legacy. Even Blue Bloods who appear to be somewhat older are in unusually good physical condition and rarely suffer from any of the various age-related maladies. In addition, many who appear to have graying hair or wrinkles actually look much younger, but use magical or conventional techniques of disguise so as not to make Sleepers wonder why someone who is supposedly in her late 70s actually looks like she is in her mid 30s.",
        "background": "Some Blue Bloods were born to wealth and many of those who were not found some path to wealth, power or influence before they joined. However, there are also a number of members from far more modest backgrounds. The primary commonality between members is a high degree of self-discipline and a desire to attain some goal that requires large amounts of time and effort.<div>Members of this Legacy typically see health and longevity as another path to power and are people who have learned the value of long-term planning. However, the particular goals they seek are exceedingly diverse. Because of the Legacy’s association with the Silver Ladder, most members have political, financial or social ambitions. However, a substantial minority are scholars engaged in various extremely long-term research projects.</div><div>A few members are simply individuals who are obsessed with health, longevity and attaining physical and mental perfection for the sake of becoming as perfect as a person can become in the Fallen World. As a result, this Legacy contains everything from wealthy business people seeking greater wealth and power to advanced yoga practitioners who strive to perfect themselves both mentally and physically. However, in all cases members have learned patience, self-discipline and the value of single-minded dedication to a goal.</div>",

In addition to their level of Attainment, the other important marker of members’ status and position is age. Older members, especially those who are still in excellent health and who appear far younger than their actual years, are regarded as both magically and morally superior to both younger mages and older members who look anything like their actual age. Because members often have completely unrelated goals, differences in status mean little beyond expectations of courtesy and deference.<div>Members hold regular but relatively informal gatherings. Attendance is not mandatory and a few members never attend any gatherings. However, these meetings are excellent places where members can network with one another and discover whether any of their goals and projects are sufficiently related that working together would be useful. In addition, for older members these meetings often become a valuable source of social stability. Because Blue Bloods usually outlive all of the Sleepers and many of the mages they know, keeping in touch with others with similar experiences and memories often becomes a great comfort for older members. For many older members, the Legacy becomes a social club in which they can freely interact with others who may have completely different interests, but who remember the same trivial and pivotal events that almost no one else is old enough to know as anything other than historical curiosities.</div>",

The mage must choose how the bonus from each of his dots in the Life Arcana is applied. All these effects are continuous and the mage can divide these bonuses as desired. The mage must take a reflexive action if he wishes to switch how these bonuses are applied. With 3 dots of Life, the mage could give himself +2 to Initiative in a fight and halve the time it takes bashing damage to heal. After the fight, the mage could switch the bonuses and cause all his bashing damage to heal four times as rapidly as normal and double the time before he suffers deprivation or fatigue.

This healing is compatible with the Quick Healer Merit, but not the healing bonuses to bashing damage from the previous Attainment.

Considering themselves to be almost minor lords of creation, these mages are able to move easily through life because they always have needed objects or cash on hand and few material obstacles can block their way. Known as Drifters, these mages are not prone to accept rules made by others. Instead, they see the world as something that is theirs to shape and alter as they will. Some care little about others, most are at least moderately compassionate, but few see any point in allowing anything other than their own choices and desires to dictate their actions.</p><p>The history of the Reality Makers is as unusual as their abilities and attitudes. They are an offshoot of the Sisterhood of the Blessed (see p. 174). During the mid 1920s, a cabal of the more progressively minded Blessed agreed to train a male mage who went by the name Utopian in their Legacy. However, word of the cabal’s efforts reached the leaders of the Blessed, who regarded the idea of men among their number as a threat. So the cabal was ordered to cease training Utopian, who was then left with only a partial knowledge of the Blessed’s first Attainment. One of the cabal’s Sleepwalker servants, who had recently Awakened, joined him. She chose the Shadow Name Celesta and had hoped to be accepted in the Blessed until she noticed most members’ attitude toward Utopian and also how the more conservative members reacted toward any members of lower class birth.</p><p>Together, Utopian and Celesta used the small bits of knowledge they had gained from the Blessed to create their own Legacy, one that used luck not as a tool for Byzantine manipulations, but simply as a way to allow members to more easily make their way in the world when they lacked the benefits of wealth and social class. To this, they added the ability to create objects out of nothing, an ability that proved exceptionally useful to poor mages seeking to advance themselves.</p><p>Members of this Legacy are commonly known as Drifters in large part because they believe a sufficiently able person should never need to exert herself except when she wishes to and that with enough skill and cleverness it is possible to bypass or eliminate any obstacle. For most Drifters, directly attacking an obstacle is both foolish and a mark of desperation.</p><p>Reality Makers seek to swiftly and easily bypass and avoid obstacles put before them and to reserve their attention for matters that interest them. The idea that there is any virtue in struggle or needless hard work is completely antithetical to members of this Legacy.</p><p>Instead, for them the best evidence someone is successful and worthy of respect is if this person never has to work at anything he does not enjoy. Reality Makers also believe no problem is insoluble and that skill and cleverness are far superior ways of solving problems than hard work or any similarly direct approach.</p><p>Although few discuss their feelings outside the Legacy, many Drifters sincerely feel they deserve to be treated well by the world and are completely entitled to all the benefits this Legacy provides. Some members feel they have some special destiny or purpose this Legacy will help them pursue. However, most are simply seeking wealth and power and regard finding the easiest and most elegant method of accomplishing these goals as the best possible choice.</p><p>Many mages find Drifters strange and even paradoxical, and often describe them as highly dedicated dilettantes or as being exceptionally ambitious in their laziness. To the Reality Makers themselves, there is no contradiction in their views, because they firmly believe success should come easily if one knows the right tricks to achieve it. While they can’t precisely pull live rabbits out of hats, pulling fifty-dollar bills, high security ID badges or similar items out of their pockets is often far more useful.</p>",

Their Attainments allow them not only to always appear at their best, but to appear appropriately attired for every situation. To someone who knows what to look for, they are often fairly easy to spot. If a group of people is walking down the sidewalk just after the start of a sudden torrential rainstorm, the Drifter will be the only one who is never splashed with water by passing cars, and who just happens to have a small umbrella in her purse or bag.",
        "background": "Unlike many of the members of legacies and other organizations associated with the Silver Ladder, most Drifters started life relatively poor. The vast majority were dissatisfied with the circumstance of their birth, but saw suggestions about working hard to get ahead as a trap for the foolish and the overly naïve. Instead, most Drifters sought a wide variety of non-standard ways to advance their wealth and station.<p>Some resorted to various sorts of criminal endeavors and others created their own unusual options like bluffing their way up the social ladder or taking a job because it allowed them spend time around wealthy and powerful people and thus obtain the personal contacts and patronage they needed to improve their lives. Most Drifters grew up believing they were either destined for greatness or just as entitled to the privileges of wealth and power as people who were born to it. Drifters are almost always as ambitious as most other members of the Silver Ladder, but their ambitions are usually purely personal and often involve finding a position of wealth, comfort and respect.</p><p>Some Reality Makers have other, somewhat darker ideas. They enjoy playing various sorts of clandestine games or finding ways to retaliate against the wealthy and the powerful by infiltrating their social circles and then using this access as a means to facilitate theft, blackmail, corporate espionage or various similar pursuits. When they Awaken, these individuals often develop even larger ambitions, and take great joy in being able to humble the powerful with so little risk or effort.</p>",

As people who specialize in finding unusual ways to accomplish goals, Drifters excel at networking and upon joining this Legacy most find they can easily turn to other Drifters for the help they may need.<p>However, Drifters have little tolerance for members who are either stupid or useless. Drifters who either consistently ask for help because they have caused themselves problems they should have been able to avoid, or who frequently ignore requests for aid from other Drifters rapidly develop a bad reputation and soon find themselves unable to obtain aid from other members of this Legacy unless they pay for these services in advance. Drifters in this problematic position also often find themselves asked to perform services significantly more difficult than any favor they are asking. In this way, the informal network of Drifters maintains order and helps to insure members act responsibly toward one another, even if they often seek to evade other responsibilities.</p>",

Members also know how to avoid notice at least as well as they can attract it, and many can easily manage to leave a room several minutes before anyone notices they are gone.</div>",
        "background": "Until the early 1960s, the Sisterhood of the Blessed was an almost exclusively female Legacy open specifically to women from wealthy and upper middle class backgrounds. Women who joined the Sisterhood used it to help them simultaneously accomplish their goals via subtle means and to maintain the respectability their social role demanded. Although not a formal requirement, the greater portion of members had 3 or more dots in the Resources Merit.<div>Since the 1960s, the Sisterhood has opened itself to male mages; however, even today slightly less than a third of the members are men. Also, regardless of their sex, members are expected to be skilled in the social graces and most are still relatively wealthy. In addition, members must be used to working behind the scenes and skilled at accomplishing their goals without allowing others to know they were involved in any way with the outcome of their schemes.</div><div>Many members are society wives, wealthy dilettantes, and similar people who do not take an obviously active roll in the affairs of the world. Since the late 1960s, this Legacy has also attracted the attention of a few spies involved in both corporate and governmental espionage. Almost all of these excel in long-term deep undercover work. They typically gather various forms of protected information while posing as diplomats or well-paid consultants, rather than acting as covert commandos or sub-machinegun wielding assassins.</div>",
        "organizzation": "The Sisterhood of the Blessed is one of the few Legacies to have a public presence. The Sisterhood originally disguised itself as a small but exclusive sorority for wealthy and influential women. Members then used a mixture of Fate and Mind magics to make certain Sleepers rarely had any interest in joining this exclusive organization. In the past, members regularly visited one another, staying at their houses and talking about both seeming trivialities and secrets of magic. Members were also exceedingly skilled at sending seemingly innocuous letters to one another that were actually written in elaborate codes. Today, members learn to subtly text message one another or hold long distance telepathic conversations while talking on the phone about seemingly mundane matters. Because travel is so easy now, especially for the wealthy, members meet several times a year as part of the exclusive club to which they belong.<div>This club, like the actual Legacy, is run according to a strict hierarchy based upon both length of membership and the social position the member occupies in Sleeper society. Most of the time, this hierarchy is largely symbolic, with higher ranking members being granted various minor privileges such as having the choicest rooms in the hotel in which the club meets. However, if problems arise for the Legacy or its leaders, members are also expected to obey their leaders and help them in any way they can.</div>",

While they cannot use this effect to give others bad luck, they are assured a host of minor coincidences will make their lives slightly easier and more pleasant than they otherwise might be. In addition, by simply wishing for something and making a successful Manipulation + Subterfuge + Fate roll, the Blessed can gain the benefit of the “Shifting the Odds” spell (Mage: The Awakening, p. 153), thus allowing her to cause luck to help her attain a specific goal.",

In addition to this effect granting the Blessed the possibility of an unparalleled degree of success at a task, her success seems to be the result more of a strange and lucky chance than of superlative skill. By taking a 2-die penalty on the dice pool for the roll to activate this effect, the mage can even make the effort seem completely accidental. The character might drop a basketball she is carrying, which then bounces and seems to go through the basketball hoop completely by happenstance. Similarly, the character might shoot someone by dropping a gun, which then seems to accidentally fire when it hits the ground.",

Careful use of this Attainment allows the Blessed to control and manipulate those around them to an exceedingly precise degree."

Not content merely to witness things to come, these willworkers feel called to involve themselves in the futures they witness, whether to facilitate a just and wise outcome or to thwart a dark and hubristic one — as the Stewards themselves reckon such things, of course.</div><div>While some few of the so-called “Augurs” hold theirs is a Legacy that reaches back to the days of Atlantis itself, more pragmatic historians among them concede the present incarnation of the Celestial Orrery likely began sometime during the early Renaissance, among the Italian city-states. At that time, heavenly bodies were simultaneously objects of both scientific and mystical scrutiny, and even the most learned perceived no paradox in studying the motions of the stars as a scholar while also reading them for omens of the future. But the Stewards, as they are known today, were not, it seems, the creation of any renowned astronomer or celebrated mystic. Rather, they are the descendants of a mysterious and virtually unknown Theurgist who went only by the name Valeria. Modern Augurs, unfortunately, have no surviving records by which to know whether this was her real name, her Shadow Name, or merely an alias; only a scant few notes and that one name. Attempts by Stewards to study Valeria with the Time Arcanum have invariably met with failure, however, suggesting she may have gleaned secrets never handed down to her students.</div><div>The Augurs and the Silver Ladder were a natural fit for one another and the Stewards of the Celestial Orrery were soon absorbed into the order almost completely and without complaint on either side. The Legacy’s devotion to the ineffable “will of the Oracles” was admired by many other théarchs, even those who found its members’ implicit belief in their superior access to Supernal truth a bit off-putting. Those few Stewards who opted to go into other orders were closely watched (especially those who chose the Guardians of the Veil), but were permitted to go their way in peace. If any Augurs accepted the path of the Apostate, there exist no records of the Legacy to tell of them, and such sad hermits, if any, likely lived and died as nothing more than unsung historical curiosities.</div><div>The years following the Renaissance were good ones for the Stewards, whose knowledge of the flow of time enabled the Silver Ladder to make some meaningful gains throughout Europe’s great age of colonization. The théarchs of one or two particularly old Consilii in the New World claim the visions of the Augurs directly led to the settlement of Awakened colonists in the area. Some Stewards, calling upon their knowledge of the essential energies of magic, learned how to bring to life ancient machineries crafted by willwork scattered here and there in the places conquerors and missionaries first trod upon unknown shores. By the time the era of exploration began to draw to a close and the nebulous edges of the map became firm and inviolate, the Augurs were scattered all over the globe, following their prophecies and seeking to discern the inscrutable will of the Oracles of Atlantis.</div><div>As the 19th century drew to a close, however, an event the Stewards of the Celestial Orrery did not foresee came to pass: the creation of a self-proclaimed “new order” in the Great Refusal of 1899. Mentors and students sought one another out, over even vast distances, and old colleagues corresponded on the contentious subject. In the end, none could explain this singular aberration, and the Augurs collectively determined the so-called “Free Council” was the direct result of a temporal error, the product of flawed causality, effectively, an idea that had no right to exist. The confidence of the Silver Ladder in its prophets was shaken, however, and the Stewards were thereafter no better or worse regarded, overall, than any other Legacy within the Vox Draconis. Still, the efforts of individual Augurs have, in the intervening years, greatly benefited cabals, Consilii and, occasionally, Awakened society on a wider scale, and so these willworkers are still esteemed for their divinatory powers, even if the Silver Ladder is no longer willing to take their predictions purely on faith.</div>",

        "appearance": "For the most part, Augurs prefer to dress in stately, conservative styles when in public, often in ways that hint at civil or (especially) spiritual authority. Thus, even young Stewards can tend to appear older than they truly are to those who don’t know them well. In private, however, fashion commonly gives way to comfort, though some Augurs opt to go so far as to attire themselves as ascetics when out of the public eye. When conducting rites (whether alone, within the Legacy, for members of the Silver Ladder, or for the Awakened community as a whole), Stewards often dress in elaborate robes suitable for the priesthood of lost Atlantis. Such garments tend to be richly embroidered and may depict glyphs in the High Speech, symbols indicative of the mage’s Sleeper faith, if any, celestial bodies, scenes from Atlantean myth and/or other, similar imagery.",
        "background": "Augurs are often drawn from those called to leadership within religious, spiritual or mystical hierarchies: ambitious clergy and ranking members of secret societies with metaphysical leanings, for instance. Some come out of astronomical studies, however, as the motions of the heavens are of especial interest to the Stewards. Others come from the ranks of watchmakers, machinists, quality assurance professionals and the like, vocations that involve the establishment and maintenance of order on whatever scale. Such willworkers may be introverts or extroverts, but they are often at least a little bit abrasive, as the chaos of social interaction tends to grate on their sensibilities.",

At the pinnacle of this structure are the Oracles, whose wisdom descends from the Supernal to those théarchs with the courage and humility necessary to receive it. As direct servants to the will of the Oracles — as handed down to them through visions and divinations — Augurs maintain they are true philosopher-priests of fallen Atlantis, and are owed the respect (and, depending upon the views of the individual Augur, the obedience) of other mages of the Atlantean Diamond. Those who best distinguish themselves in positions of spiritual authority among the Awakened earn the greatest esteem within the Legacy, and the counsel of such theocrats is heeded by other Stewards, both young and old. Important to note, however, is the fact that an Augur’s ambition must be married to an ethic of sincere service; she must genuinely desire greater temporal power for the purpose of improving her utility as an instrument of the Oracles’ will, first and foremost. Otherwise, her brethren will quickly see through her lies and know her hubris for what it is.",

One turn per success is glimpsed, though spells and other abilities that conceal temporal senses penalize this roll by 1 per point of Potency (or 1 per success for powers not derived from the Arcana). The willworker must be exacting regarding her desired objective — “the Hierarch’s office” is insufficient. Instead, she might wish to see “the Hierarch’s office when it is next entered by someone other than the Hierarch,” “Daniel Nolan at exactly 3:10 AM, Eastern Standard Time, on Tuesday the 28th of this month,” or “the very beginning of Lee and Marion’s fiftieth wedding anniversary party.”<div>Note that the Augur must somehow be in the presence of the individual, object, location or phenomenon the future of which she wishes to see, in order for this Attainment to work. (Standing in a room, for example, allows the mage to view any point in that room’s future, while being near a person or Artifact enables her to peer forward and see what is in store for the object of her scrutiny.) Also, events that will not come to pass (if, say, Lee and Marion should get divorced after three years of marriage, one of them dies before the start of their fiftieth year together, or they simply do not have a party to celebrate the occasion), then the Steward receives no vision. Also note that the very act of witnessing the future can set into motion events that change the outcome the mage has foreseen (which, many Augurs argue, is, indeed, the very purpose of their Legacy).

Just like a normal Hallow, the mage may produce Mana in this fashion only once per day. While the Augur may not perform an oblation to recover Mana through the use of this Attainment, other Awakened may draw upon the power that radiates from her refined spirit."

At that time, across the American Midwest, Consilii, like Sleeper populations, trickled away and disappeared utterly as arable land withered and the dust storms closed in to devour the remains. Those were bleak times, hopeless times, and people did whatever they had to in order to escape from it, in whatever small ways they could. Some, however, aspired to a somewhat more literal deliverance from the death that surrounded them.</div><div>He went by numerous aliases, depending upon which one-horse town his carnival happened to be visiting at the time: Alaric Swift, Jacob Brauer, Hezekiah Munson, and many more. He was good-looking, with a quick wit and an easy charm in the manner of many Acanthus. To the Awakened of his acquaintance he was called Lucius Nero, fiddling while the world as they knew it burned. Within the Silver Ladder he was regarded as a joker and a bit of a rogue, lining his threadbare pockets with the meager wealth of dustcaked yokels in exchange for a few hours of wonder and laughter. And, if one or two people went slowly mad in the wake of his passing, none were the wiser, for those were days in which crushing, endless sorrow took hold of many hearts and did not let go. To Nero’s thinking, he gave a little bit of joy and he took a little something in return — a fair trade. </div><div>The truth of the matter is that Lucius Nero delved into many dark magics during his long circuits through the Dust Bowl, searching in vain for some way to rise above all the dying he saw and so desperately feared. Eventually he learned to steal the miraculous light that burns within every person and used those plundered spirits as the ante in his gamble to swindle the Reaper. Nero never found what he was looking for, but he did manage to transform himself into something else, something more than merely Awakened — something blasphemous. When the day at long last came that the dust stopped choking the nation, Lucius Nero, showman of the wasteland, chiseler of souls, was the first Charlatan of the Carnival Melancholy, and his was the power to extinguish the human spark in exchange for a wink and a nod from Lady Luck. In time, he passed down his lore to a handful of others who carried it to the far corners of the nation and beyond. </div><div>Nowadays, the Awakened of the Carnival Melancholy remain faithful to their roots as clowns and comedians, mummers and mountebanks. They hawk their dross and walk away with a prize more precious than gold. An infection within the Silver Ladder, these willworkers are possessed of all the skills of showmanship necessary not only to enact the old rites of the order, but also to make them compelling and even entertaining. Following their own skewed view of the Elemental Precepts, the Charlatans see the Awakened as one nation in exile doing whatever is necessary to survive and prosper, while they themselves seize the Imperium Mysteriorum and ascend the Silver Ladder upon the backs of the Sleepers, dragging along their disincarnate souls as they walk the path toward the everlasting Supernal. </div><div>Some, as did their spiritual ancestor, Lucius Nero, still search for the secrets of immortality, but others are content merely to have their fun at the Fallen World’s expense and to crack wise at the terrible grandeur of its bleakness until they choke on laughter and shuffle off the stage, smiling. Socially cunning and too damned charming for anyone’s good, Charlatans often manage to ingratiate themselves into some comfortable corner of local Awakened society, whether as long-term residents of the Consilium or just as transients bartering for a few nights in a comfortable bed and at a wellstocked dinner table. From the good, old-fashioned, “Step right up!” to offers to sell MP3 players that “fell off the back of a truck,” to games of three-card Monte on street corners and in back alleys, the Carnival Melancholy keeps alive the ways of the charismatic grifter, running a long con on life itself.</div>",

In many ways, the Charlatan surrenders his identity to the costume he wears, allowing him to hide behind the mantle of the performer.

Only in the rarest of instances do Charlatans gather in any numbers, and then only two or three at a time.

The Charlatan may now attach a severed Sleeper soul to a mundane (in other words, non-magical) object, which conveys upon its wielder the benefits of the optional Fate 3 component of the previous Attainment for dice rolls specifically using the item. (Strength + Weaponry for a knife, for instance, or Wits + Medicine for a doctor’s bag.) The object’s user – who may be a mage or a Sleeper – must somehow be made aware that it is a “lucky” item (allowing her to subconsciously make use of its properties), though she need not truly believe in its powers. The soul trapped within the item is undetectable and its Morality is consumed with each use, as per the second Attainment, above. If the Charlatan possesses the third optional Attainment of the Carnival Melancholy, he may allow the use of that ability to the item’s wielder, as well as (or instead of) the first one, though the choice is fixed when the soul is impressed into the item. The mage benefits from a two-step modifier when attempting to forge a sympathetic tie to an individual currently carrying a soul-bonded object of his creation; this bonus goes only one way, to the Charlatan’s benefit, and is undetectable by magic.</div><div>A Charlatan may impress Sleeper souls into as many individual items as he has dots in the Fate Arcanum; excess attempts simply fail. To create another such object when he is at his current limit, the willworker must either release 1 soul from its prison (which he may do at any range as a reflexive action), or else wait for at least 1 soul to be fully expended by an item’s current wielder.</div>",

        "descrizione": "<div>The syntax of the spoken language of Atlantis isn’t fully understood by any mage alive today. Small nuances in how a word is spoken, or used, can create major differences in meaning that would be almost impossible to comprehend just by studying the writings of a dead language. This is especially true in a tonal language (such as Chinese) in which the same word can have multiple meanings depending on how the syllable is stressed. It is no wonder, then, that some Atlantean words are difficult to translate properly into modern languages built on comparatively limited concepts. There are some who claim that Timori is one such word that has likely received an incomplete translation.</div><div>Timori can certainly be translated as fearful. The word probably was used in association with the Locust-Eaters, who forsook magic to take their place in what they perceived as the natural order of the world. But those who tread this path state that another possible translation for Timori, one that has been overlooked or suppressed by modern scholars, is “feared.”</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Feared vs. Fearful</h3><div>The mages of this Legacy do indeed referto themselves as Timori, instead of differentiating themselves by calling themselves “the True Timori” or some such. The confusion works in their favor. It’s easy for one of the enemy to mistake the Timori for fearful rather than the Feared. We hope this isn’t too confusing for readers. Within the context of this Legacy’s section, the phrase Timori will be used to refer to this Legacy in particular, as they do. Throughout the rest of the book, Timori is used in the usual fashion, as another term for “Banisher.”</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>According to the Legacy’s lore, their forebears weren’t content to simply take their leave of Atlantis and hope that the natural order sorted itself out. These mages had much more in common with their contemporary Banisher fellows than the more peaceful types who simply abandoned Atlantis. Those who refused to abandon Atlantis fought against the intrusion of magic into the world. They attacked magical constructs, destroyed repositories of magical knowledge and killed any mage they thought they could safely target. Although they disliked the use of magic, the Atlantean Banishers reluctantly concluded that it was necessary to use fire to fight fire. Citizens of Atlantis began to whisper about the traitors in their midst, calling them Timori, the feared, and the Banishers took up the name with pride. Eventually, the Timori cabals were uncovered by the Ungula Draconis and were either killed or forced into exile.</div><div>Various records of the Atlantean era speak of the armies of Atlantis marching against the poorly developed tribes and city-states of the time. These attacks are usually explained by Awakened scholars as a symptom of the hubris that lead to Atlantis’s fall, but there are hints in the writings that suggest other possibilities. Here and there in the tales of the Atlantean armies’ exploits, a determined researcher can see a pattern. Phrases that are routinely translated as “And the fearful lived among the lesser people of the tribe and taught them to fear and hate us” take on a different meaning when fearful is translated as feared. It certainly seems likely that exiled Timori raised Sleeper armies to attack Atlantean shipping and outposts. When viewed in this light, not every action taken by Atlantis against the primitive societies seems like such an overt act of hubris. </div><div>Years passed, and the Timori continued their harassment of Atlantean assets. Ungula Draconis teams sent out to deal with the Timori met with limited success, never managing to completely stamp them out. The Timori had resigned themselves to the idea that their battle might take centuries, when the first Mage War occurred. After celebrating their victory, the remaining mages of Atlantis raised their Ladder to the Heavens, and the worst nightmares of the Timori seemed to have come true.</div><div>The Timori sought meetings with the newly exiled mages, to convince them anew of the Timori’s position. Reluctant at first to even speak to the Timori, let alone meet with them, the Exiles finally agreed to a temporary alliance when reality began to crack. Using the Sleeper armies of the Timori to assist, the Exiles took their fight back to Atlantis. While the Exiles fought their way up the Ladder into the Supernal, the Timori began to attempt to unravel the spells holding the Ladder together. Then came the explosion that sundered the world.</div><div>The majority of the Timori at ground zero of the explosion were killed instantly by the collapse of the Ladder. Those who survived wept in despair. Despite their best efforts, the natural order of the world was destroyed, seemingly for good. The Timori went to the leaders of the surviving exiled mages and begged them to give up magic.</div><div>“Look,” the Timori said, “at what our power has wrought. This is the awful cost of magic!”</div><div>The Exiles, not seeing how they could possibly survive without their magic, refused the Timori’s entreaties and drove the Timori from them; the short alliance forever ended.</div><div>With the Awakened community scattered and the members of the Timori reduced to a mere handful, the Timori decided on a new course of action. It would be impossible for them to watch each new mage settlement, let alone stage successful attacks, at their current numbers. New Banishers who attempted to seek the Timori out for wisdom were also unlikely to survive such a quest if the Timori remained concentrated in one place. After much debate, a solution was agreed to; the Timori must become immortal. Only by avoiding the gaze of death did they have any chance at replenishing their numbers and continuing their battles.</div><div>The search for immortality was not a new idea for any mage community. Immortality was, indeed, one of the reasons the mages of Atlantis stormed the Supernal Realms. Abandoning, for now, their war against other mages, the Timori began to research how they could achieve their goal. Years stretched into decades as the Timori continued on their quest. The members of the cabal were growing older and older, and soon it turned into a race to see whether they could succeed in their task before they vanished from the Earth. Finally, the Timori discovered that the secret to immortality lay at the very core what makes a mage. They discovered that by ritually devouring Mana and Gnosis from a living host they could infuse their Patterns with enough raw magical energy to stop or even turn back the clock.</div><div>This solution delighted the Timori. It furthered their fight against mages and also ensured that if they were ever successful in completely eliminating magic from the world that, they, too, would then die. Newly empowered by their discovery, the Timori split their forces to ensure a large enough supply of Gnosis for each of them to survive and went back to war.</div><div>By the time the Feared began to prey on the fledgling magical communities, the Exiles believed the Feared to be long dead. The Exiles now blamed mage slayings on a group the Exiles called Banishers. Puzzled by this, the Timori investigated the Exiles’ claims and discovered that the old order of peaceful naturalists had given way after the sundering. Those who might once have become like the Locust-Eater seemed driven by an almost instinctual fear and hatred of magic. The word Timori was now used exclusively to describe these new killers of mages, and the true Timori saw the advantage in maintaining in this belief.</div><div>Since the rest of the Awakened believed the more organized factions to be dead, the Timori hid themselves from view. They worked from the shadows, using Banishers as pawns, to divide mages from their cabals where they were more easily captured and their Gnosis harvested.</div><div>Such is the history claimed by those Timori who call themselves Feared. They allow other Banishers to cause an uproar, prodding and herding them in the proper directions, then swoop in to collect their prey. Every once in a while, a Banisher Awakens with more than the usual instinctive hatred of magic, and the Timori keep their eyes open for those rare individuals to train as apprentices. Though their numbers are still small compared to order mages, the number of Timori grows more often than it shrinks, setting the stage for the time when the Feared are ready to emerge from hiding and declare open war on the Awakened once more.</div>",

Nothing comes without a price, however, and the Timori suffer from a couple of ailments as a result of meddling with their Patterns.</div><div>Because their bodies are more like preserved corpses than normal, healthy bodies, the Timori have effectively removed their bodies from the Life Arcanum. As they saturate their Patterns with raw infusions of magical power, their bodies begin to crystallize. The result of the crystallization is that the Timori cannot be affected by any Life spell that changes their Patterns in a significant manner. Any attempt to transfigure, hone, heal or wound the Timori, as the result of a Life spell, automatically fails.</div><div>The other condition suffered by all Timori is addiction. From the first time a Timori tastes Mana that has been harvested from a living host, he longs to relive the experience. No high, not that of drugs or sex, can compare with the sensation of stolen Mana. The addiction only worsens when the Timori first tastes Gnosis. Mana addiction is only a mental addiction, but addiction to Gnosis is a true mind and body addiction. All Timori gain the Flaw: Addiction (see the World of Darkness Rulebook, p. 218) from the moment they use their Quintessal Harvest Attainment. This Flaw may never be overcome regardless of how long a Timori goes without consuming Mana or Gnosis.</div><div>Use of Timori Attainments damages the minds and bodies of the mages the Timori target. A mage may only be subjected to an Attainment, or any combination of Attainments, a number of times equal to his Stamina + Gnosis. Once this total has been exceeded, the mage becomes a shattered wreck that is of no further value to the Timori and is disposed of. Mages who have been so thoroughly violated in this manner (who manage to escape their tormentors) are broken people. A very small percentage of these pitiful figures may eventually be able to recover from their ordeal, but most simply go insane and frequently end their own lives.</div><div>The use of the Attainments listed below is not strictly considered spellcasting, and any call for an extended roll does not follow the usual rules for the length of an extended casting.</div>",

The Timori may store up to twice their maximum Mana pool in stolen Mana in their Patterns, but if the Mana isn’t used immediately, it bleeds out of their Patterns at a rate of one Mana per day. The Timori can spend stored Mana at a rate per turn equal to their Gnosis rating (with Gnosis 5, the Timori can spend five stored Mana per turn). Stored Mana may be used for one of the following effects:</div><ul><li>The Timori may reinforce their Patterns with Mana to resist the effects of aging. The Timori age one day for every week that passes for each point of Mana used in this way.</li><li>Because their bodies are so heavily fortified with magic, the Timori may spend stored Mana to heal themselves.

Spending stored Mana to heal is considered a reflexive action.</li><li>If a Timori manages to completely saturate his Pattern (i.e., reach his maximum allowance) with Mana, he may choose to convert all of the stored Mana in one fell swoop to increase his magical prowess. For each five Mana spent in this way, the Timori gains one Arcane Experience point. Use of stored Mana in this fashion ignores the normal restrictions for how much stored Mana may be spent per turn.</li></ul><div>Many Timori will feed captured mages regular sources of Mana so the Timori can prolong the pleasure of Quintessal Harvest for as long as possible.

        "descrizione": "<div>One of the most feared and reviled among the Pandemonium-fueled Legacies of the Mastigos, the Dreamers of the Black Sun are an active force of chaos and pain in the mortal world. Merciless, fanatical and consumed by fear, their presence is said to herald the deaths of hundreds. Some believe that the Dreamers are corrupt victims of their own mystic energies, drawn helplessly to calamity and forced to inure themselves to the pain they witness. Others, however, know the Dreamers better: these mages are appalling engineers of disaster, slowly immolating themselves in the same fires that consume their victims. Power plant explosions, tunnel collapses, airplane and train crashes — all are projects of the Dreamers, and all are organized to empower their malicious works.</div><div>Founded in the dark days of the bloody Aztec Flower Wars, the Dreamers of the Black Sun are the priests and directors of a mystic organization now known as the Black Sun Cult. Spawned by the disillusioned, cynical instruction of a 13th-century Mastigos named Tochel, their teachings are a mishmash of Aztec and Atlantean lore, twisted by imperfect interpretation and willful misdirection.</div><div>Members of the Black Sun Cult believe that the mortal world is warped and corrupt by design — a misbegotten, chaos-laced creation built by hubristic, degenerate gods. In these mages’ eyes, perversion is implicit in the design of every earthly object and inhabitant. A paradise once existed, they argue, and it was torn apart to provide the base material for the ruinous human world. This paradise is identified with Tamoanchan, the mythical Aztec world of Itzpapalotl, the great and terrible Obsidian Butterfly. The only survivors of its destruction are the demonic Tzitzimime, distorted spirits of vengeance bent on the annihilation of Earth. Trapped in the sky and hidden by the sun, they await the day of unending eclipse when they will drop to Earth and visit the righteous fury of their forgotten world on all of humanity.</div><div>The influence of the Black Sun Cult extends throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. The cult members’ presence is concentrated in urban centers, with little or no membership in rural or other, less populous zones. If reports are to be believed, though, individual cells have begun to travel outwards, appearing recently in surprising places: Brazil, Barcelona, even Tokyo. Whether these emergences indicate an expansion of the cult or a dispersion of existing membership is unknown to observers. </div><div>The Dreamers often communicate with spirits they identify as Tzitzimime, hearing their whispers from the rippling chaos of Pandemonium. To empower the agents of Tamoanchan and better receive their guidance (or even encourage their manifestation in the mortal world), the mages of the Black Sun Cult work to provide sacrifice on a grand scale, sabotaging structures and transport systems in an effort to murder dozens or hundreds of souls at once. These sacrifices are ritually prepared and carried out so as to channel energy to the Tzitzimime, providing them with the strength to slip their bonds and come to Earth. Eventually, the Dreamers hope, the energy gathered will be sufficient to bring about the day of unending eclipse and end the pain of life.</div><div>Black Sun magic makes use of the raw power of fear, ritually occluding conscious thought by immersing the practitioner in base terror and opening a conduit for the energies of Pandemonium to pass through. They call this “opening the bone passage,” a practice that puts considerable physical strain on the mage. To help stimulate the effect, Dreamers often subject themselves to threatening circumstances with little or no guarantee of survival, trusting their own power to preserve them. Many actually remain at the site of a planned sacrifice (for instance, sitting as a passenger in an airplane that has been sabotaged), allowing themselves to participate in the tragedy and risk becoming its victims. The heightening of fear that precedes the event often provides them with enough power to survive once it begins — but not always.</div><div>Their pursuit of fear is not always fueled by magical study, though. Some of the members of the Legacy become addicted to the sensation so essential to their workings, noting that they become bored and listless without the extreme stimulus they are accustomed to. Many turn to masochistic practice, pushing themselves further and further into the world of self-inflicted pain in an attempt to chase the adrenal high of panic.</div><div>The Dreamers were once a minor Legacy with relatively little influence in the mortal world. Among the Aztecs, the Dreamers were a death cult without the power to match their rivals, constantly at risk of complete destruction. Even in modern nights, their numbers are too few and their practice too dangerous to allow functional long-term organization. Turnover is frequent in the cult, and on average, the Dreamers lose members faster than they gain them. Only the dedication of a few surviving tutors has kept the Legacy alive at all. However, the advents of mass transit and modern weaponry have made it relatively easy for smaller numbers to have a greater overall impact. Even with a dwindling membership, the cult is achieving larger and more frequent sacrifice, leading to thousands of mortal deaths in recent years. To lend some perspective to the threat they now embody, enemies of the cult have noted that energies harvested by the Black Sun mages during the last 10 years may well surpass those gathered during the whole of the preceding century.</div><div>Because of the mages’ activities, the cult’s enemies often make a point of hunting down and neutralizing the Dreamers of the Black Sun. The practices of the cult are abhorrent to outsiders and cannot be tolerated in good conscience. While the Dreamers don’t make a policy of seeking conflict with their own kind, individual members can become quite enthused about the battles that come their way, finding great satisfaction in deadly magical conflict.</div><div>It’s true that the Dreamers are not entirely unredeemable. Individual cases of repentance and rejection of the values of the Black Sun Cult have been reported, lending hope to those who seek a peaceful means to end their crimes. Former members often become great crusaders against the actions of their Legacy, working tirelessly to end its murderous activities. The cult itself cares little about losing members, and makes no effort to pursue its former adherents.</div><div>And yet, the organization still survives. One by one, new mages add their power to the Black Sun cause, regardless of the dangers involved. The tutors of the Legacy find disenfranchised students, drawing them into the teachings of Tamoanchan. The Dreamers may be few, but their fervor is intensifying, as if distilled. The fewer there are, the harder they are to find and the more dangerous they become.</div>",

Many examples of such ancient controls exist: Stonehenge, Mayan temples and even some Roman roads exist along ley lines or sit atop powerful nodes. By focusing the energy that courses over the Earth, the ancients were able to influence natural and unnatural occurrences wherever the energy flowed. They could cause crops to produce untold harvests, or create blight that led to starvation and death. They could inspire wisdom and understanding or fuel depravity and breed despair. And, through careful control of resonance, the Tellurians could aid in the creation of a nation or bring one to its knees.</div><div>Wherever people have sought to control the power these lines possess, the Tellurians have always been nearby. Ever since the fall of Atlantis, these mages have dedicated their lives to understanding the power that flows from node to node. They have amassed vast libraries of maps detailing ley lines all over the world. However, as the world evolves and changes, so does the energy that flows around it. The work of the Tellurians is never done because the lines are constantly shifting. The original Tellurians were a disparate lot. Each discovered the power of the ley lines within their own cultures and learned to manipulate them as they advanced along their chosen Paths. Eventually they stumbled across other members of other Paths and orders who shared their interests, and the first Telluric Council was formed. They agreed that the ley lines should be observed and manipulated only for the prosperity of mankind. To enforce their will, they created the Telluric Wardens, a militant division that punishes those offenders who dare to destroy or manipulate ley lines for destructive purposes.</div><div>The Obrimos were the original founders of the Tellurians because of their leanings towards the Prime Arcanum and interest in the flow of magic. Eventually, the Mysterium became interested in these trackers of ley lines, and other Paths were introduced to the Legacy. Each Path was able to turn their particular talent to understanding the resonances that supply the main power to the ley lines. The Acanthus devote themselves primarily to understanding how the particular resonances of ley lines and nodes affect the fates of those they touch. Mastigos are often the most adept with their knowledge of the Space Arcanum, and provide some of the best cartographers the Legacy possesses. The Moros of the Legacy are few and far between, although those who have joined focus most of their attention on how the different resonances affect Matter and inanimate objects. As the Legacy’s founders, Obrimos are by far the most common Path represented. The Thyrsus are a close second within the Legacy, as they are intimately concerned with the effects ley lines have on the physical and spiritual landscapes of the world.</div>",

The Mysterium considers most of the members of the Legacy to be entertaining and largely useless old eccentrics. However, they are the foremost experts in the field of mapping and understanding of resonances. The Mysterium is where most of the Legacy’s students are recruited from as they seek mentors in the Order’s libraries to extract information on the peculiar science of ley lines.<div>The Wardens tend to come from the Adamantine Arrow. They are often found watching over nodes or acting as bodyguards to their researching colleagues. They are also the enforcers of the Telluric Council’s will, protecting fragile lines or punishing mages who disturb or destroy lines wantonly.</div><div>The Guardians of the Veil, Free Council and Silver Ladder are in the minority of the orders represented among the Mapmakers. After induction into the Legacy, most members remain in their parent order, but a fair number end up defecting to the Mysterium.</div>",
        "appearance": "The Mapmakers’ appearances often reflect their beliefs concerning ley lines. If they believe the lines are to be controlled, they tend to be neat freaks, with their clothes and surroundings perfect in every detail. If they believe in merely monitoring the lines and letting them form on their own, then their appearance may be more free-form and artistic, showing their more organic philosophy.",
        "background": "The Mapmakers come from all walks of life and have only one thing in common: They seek to understand the currents of power that flow over the earth. Some followed the traditions of the Druids, manipulating all sorts of connections from toadstool circles to Stonehenge. Others learned the arts of feng shui and manipulate the dragon lines on smaller levels in residential areas. However, they all followed their passion even after their Awakening, and sought greater understanding of ley lines through their magic. Most Mapmakers keep fastidious notes and maps so that they can keep track of the ley lines in their area and the different resonances that travel down them. Often they hold positions of power in the mortal world, which allow them to manipulate the architecture in the city they reside in or own swathes of untouched virgin forests to preserve the lines flowing within them.",
        "organizzation": "The Mapmakers are one of the more organized Legacies. They are led by the Telluric Council, comprised of the eldest living or most acclaimed members of the Legacy. Rank among the Mapmakers is due to age and accomplishment. Once in a blue moon, a younger member will perform a truly remarkable feat that earns them the respect and recognition of the Council, but most of the Mapmakers operate under the simple rule of “avoid the Council’s attention.”<div>The strongest connection within the Legacy is between mentor and student. Someone interested in joining the Legacy has to first locate a Mapmaker who is willing to take him on as a student. He is then introduced to the Attainments and the vast libraries that the Mapmakers have accumulated over the centuries in the study of ley lines. Once the mentor believes the student is ready, the student faces a test to become a full-fledged member of the Legacy. This trial usually comes after the student learns the second Attainment. The tests range from successfully documenting the resonances of a particularly complex ley line to the mapping of all lines that intersect with a particular node.</div><div>Once they successfully pass the test, they are free to do as they please. There is, however, retribution if a Mapmaker steps over the line. The Council’s interpretation of a wrongdoing does not follow most societal norms; they are far more concerned with the disruption of energy flow along the lines, and anything that destroys or significantly interferes with a large amount of ley lines will draw the Council’s immediate attention. Wardens are then dispatched to deal with the offending party.</div>",

Through mastery of Space and knowledge of the components of ley lines, the Mapmaker can enter any ley line at any point and travel to any node. Many Mapmakers explain it as opening a Portal (as per the spell in Mage: The Awakening, p. 238) and simply using the ley lines as a conduit. While they can enter a ley line at any point, they can only exit at a node, where the power lines cross and the energy is briefly disrupted. Many younger Mapmakers describe it as akin hopping a train or riding the subway. The Mapmaker can only take herself on the Ride, along with any non-living things she can hold onto. While the mage is Riding Between, they exist with the ley line and travel along its energy. They cannot be harmed until they step out at a node. Riding Between isn’t without its risks: unless the Mapmaker knows exactly where he is going, he could very well end up on top of a mountain in Tibet, in the middle of a battlefield in Africa or over the ocean in the middle of a hurricane.",

He (whatever the mage’s former gender, he now considers himself male) returns to searching for physical immortality. If possible, he bargains with other mages to restore his original sex and gaunt, Saturnine appearance. Unfortunately, the transformation infects the mage with the same inexplicable flaw that prevented the original Tazanteotl from conquering age and death. No form of magic can extend his lifespan. It can make him appear youthful and keep him strong, but he will age rapidly and die no later than the age of 80. Tazanteotl never found an alternate solution before the Fall, so if a supernatural power that might extend his life exists it must be exceedingly rare.</div><div>Tazanteotl is willing to sacrifice his host’s former friends without a second thought for even the slightest chance at true immortality. He is the Walker Without End once again, searching the world for life-extending secrets. Sometimes, Tazanteotl seeks out Atlantean ruins only he remembers, or stranger corners of the material realm, Shadow or Astral Reaches he discovered long ago.</div><div>Tazanteotl is pragmatic; he realizes his best chance to survive comes from spreading his Legacy as much as possible. Different incarnations have approached the balance between questing and converting according to prevailing circumstances. The mage often plans to update The True Soul to include memories from his current incarnation, but the original Tazanteotl created it during an act of delirious inspiration, assisted by texts he later destroyed. Until a testament to the contrary is unearthed, it appears his incarnations have succeeded only at translating the grimoire, not adding to it.</div><div>When Tazanteotl isn’t pursuing these goals he tries to regain his former abilities. He was a Master of Death, Mind and Space, an Adept of Life and had at least Initiate-ranked ability in every other Arcanum. He wasn’t a great mage by Atlantean standards but in the Fallen Age he’d be a force to be reckoned with if he had full command of his powers. Each incarnation comes with powerful memories, but many of them seem too distant, dreamlike or vague to translate into real aptitude. The incarnation is stuck with the character’s traits, with the following exceptions:</div><div><b>Attributes:</b> Permanently adjust Attributes as if the character was consumed by the alternate personality listed in the second Attainment — she is.</div><div><b>Innate Knowledge:</b> Tazanteotl speaks, reads and writes Atlantean with native ability. (See Secrets of the Ruined Temple for information on the Atlantean language.) Reduce the character’s dots in Computer, Drive, Firearms and Streetwise and use them to increase Occult and Survival, up to the dot limits imposed by the character’s Gnosis or until he runs out of dots to exchange. He also knows many things about the world as it was before the Fall of Atlantis. The Storyteller should use this to trigger stories as Tazanteotl searches for eternal life.</div><div>Tazanteotl learns Death, Mind and Space rotes for 1 Experience point per rote dot, not 2. In most cases, he’s simply refreshing his knowledge.</div><div><b>Reduced Wisdom:</b> Remove a dot of Wisdom. Tazanteotl is a moral degenerate who twists the souls of others to survive.</div><div>Is the mage truly Tazanteotl? It’s hard to know. Orthodox magical doctrine says no. Each mage has but a single soul, distinct in nature, and though magic can damage, twist and at rare times improve it, simply changing it to resemble another person’s soul doesn’t make any essential quality transfer from one to another.</div><div>Buddhist philosophers and modern neuroscientists have both provided alternative explanations: perspectives that emulate the doctrines Tazanteotl employed to write The True Soul. According to these, the nature of the soul is irrelevant when it comes to discussing identity. All that matters is continuity of experience: knowledge flowing continuously from one moment to the next. It doesn’t matter whether there’s continuity inside a single soul or between a hundred of them, jumping from one to another. If a mage has Tazanteotl’s memories, beliefs and the benefits of his experience she is the archmage, in every way that matters.</div>",

While the records of the Silver Ladder do not indicate whether the prince was, himself, Awakened, they do state that he had at least a passing knowledge of “Supernal truth.” Henry was fascinated with discovery and travel, and not above wishing to profit from both, so he assembled a coalition of explorers, mapmakers and navigators at a villa on the Sagres peninsula at the southern tip of Portugal.</div><div>Initially, only one mage — Duarte Rafael Cipriano, a Theurgist who took the Shadow Name Vespasian after the Roman Emperor — was involved in this consortium. Vespasian was not himself a navigator or mapmaker, nor was he particularly interested in discovering new countries; however, he was very interested in Prince Henry and what financial and temporal opportunities he might create, and so he ingratiated himself to the Navigator and became part of his endeavors.</div><div>The story that Vespasian would later tell to his order was this: one night in early summer, 1420, he and Prince Henry walked on the beach together, both very drunk. They looked up at the sky, and Henry said to the mage, “If I live a century and see all the lands of the world, I shall still die an ignorant child, for I shall never map the stars.” Vespasian’s heart went out to the prince, for as a Sleeper, he could not know the power and awe of seeing the Aether, but wondered if mapping the stars might be possible through magic. Vespasian explained to his contemporaries that he intended to form a cabal that would secretly work alongside the prince, helping him to achieve his goals of discovery and, at the same time, use his connections to mapmakers and explorers to find a way to map the Heavens.</div><div>Modern mages look upon this story as extremely unlikely. From all accounts, Vespasian was a disagreeable fellow, and Prince Henry never once mentioned “Duarte Rafael Cipriano” in his correspondence with anyone else. While it’s true that Vespasian spent a great deal of time around the prince, for him to share an intimate moment and a poetic lament with someone who was, for all intents and purposes, a glorified accountant is improbable, alcohol notwithstanding. More likely, Vespasian noticed which way the wind was blowing for Prince Henry — in late May of 1420, the prince was named governor of the Order of Christ (heir to the Templars in Portugal) and thus gained access to a great deal of wealth. Vespasian, having knowledge to the prince’s monetary doings, would have known that this appointment was coming, and decided to get the Silver Ladder’s backing in staying close to the prince. Whatever the truth, Vespasian accomplished his goal. Six other mages joined his nascent cabal.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Celestial Cartographers</h3><div>These seven mages (the six Vespasian recruited plus Vespasian himself) formed a cabal called the Cartógrafos Celestiais — “the Celestial Cartographers.” Vespasian tried to establish himself as leader of the cabal, but soon found himself overshadowed by a younger and more idealistic mage called Daedalus. Daedalus, a Moros, never openly questioned Vespasian’s motives, but did keep the cabal focused on its goal of discovery and ascent to the stars. Vespasian realized that he would be better off providing monetary support than trying to be a philosophical center for the cabal, and faded into the background. He died from natural causes, circa 1450, but the cabal flourished. Many of the voyages planned and sponsored by Prince Henry included either a member of the cabal or one of the proximi in service to it, and Daedalus, a Master of Space as well as Matter, always saw to it that the cabal member returned, even from a disastrous voyage.</div><div>Prince Henry died in 1460, and Daedalus vowed to carry on the Navigator’s dream of mapping the stars. He formed a new Legacy, which he threw open to any member of the Silver Ladder (and later tutored at least one Moros of the Mysterium). This Legacy, which took the name “Celestial Navigators” after Prince Henry, focused on exploration and mapping of new and strange lands. Some members of the Legacy accompanied ships to new countries (one, in fact, sailed on the Santa Maria with Christopher Columbus, but abandoned him after returning from his first voyage, calling him “a pig, a buffoon, and an opportunist — he doesn’t see people, he sees piles of gold”). Some entered the Shadow and attempted cartography and cataloging of the spirit worlds, with varying degrees of success. Some attempted to use descriptions of fables such as Prester John’s kingdom or the Fountain of Youth to open scrying windows or portals, but if any of these attempts succeeded, there are no records. The Legacy spread, and when Daedalus died, he did so knowing that he had inspired the hopes and dreams of many of the Awakened.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Made of Stars</h3><div>The Celestial Navigator Legacy remained a fairly important one in Europe (and, if rumors are to be believed, in China as well) up until the early 17th century. As exploration changed from over sea to over land, the Legacy became less common. The Silver Ladder kept records, of course, and there were still Celestial Navigators to be found, especially in southern Portugal, but it wasn’t until the formation of the Free Council that the Legacy experienced a revival.</div><div>In 1899, when the Free Council emerged as an order, the Silver Ladder was not initially enthusiastic. But one member of the Vox Draconis who supported the nascent order was a physicist named Dr. John Cressner. Gauge, as he was known to his fellow mages, believed the Free Council was a natural progression, an ideological evolution of sorts, responding both to needs within the Awakened community and changes to the Fallen World. Gauge, wishing to formally welcome the Free Council to the Awakened community of his home city (New York), found the records detailing the Celestial Navigators Legacy and presented them to the Free Council. He made a special point of mentioning that Prince Henry the Navigator’s dream of mapping the stars had not yet been realized, but perhaps that was unimportant — the dream itself was what had led to the Legacy. Gauge, himself an Obrimos, never joined a Legacy at all, but his gesture didn’t go unnoticed. Mages in the Free Council looked over the old writings and learned rotes and history that helped in their dealings with the Ladder. Mages of the Ladder, meanwhile, studied the notes and decided that the Celestial Navigators’ philosophy might be worthy of study again, especially in light of Gauge’s speech about conversion and progression.</div><div>Some years later, a cabal of mages from the Free Council and the Silver Ladder approached Gauge and asked him to collaborate on a series of magical experiments performed in conjunction with the theories of quantum mechanics. Gauge, himself an expert in the field of harmonics, agreed, and the cabal made some fascinating discoveries. Matter, they realized, was energy, and while it had long been known that a skilled mage could change energy to solid matter and back, the cabal became convinced that with the right apparatus, this conversion was possible in the Fallen World as well. In 1926, the cabal renamed itself the “Photonic Navigators,” taking the term “photon” from the work of American chemist Gilbert Lewis. Their intent was to learn to convert living matter to energy and thus travel to places unreachable even by mages.</div><div>Some of these mages, adapting the teachings of the Celestial Navigators Legacy, created a variant — the Celestial Masters. Since then, the Legacy has recruited from the Silver Ladder, the Free Council, and accepts Necromancers from other orders as well. They continue to work toward better understanding of energy conversion, hoping to one day be able to reproduce their magical feats without using magic. They recognize, though, that this goal might be impossible. This, to the Stargazers, isn’t important. The important thing is that their goal continues to inspire them, and allows them to do great things along the way.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>The Celestial Masters Legacy is one of the more accessible, given that two orders and a Path teach it. Joining requires finding a Celestial Master and making an entreaty. A background in physics isn’t strictly necessary, but applicants are required to have reached the rank of Apprentice in both Matter and Forces, and to demonstrate skill in conversion in both Arcanum.</div><div>The applicant is then required to study with his mentor, learning at least two of the following rotes (all page numbers refer to Mage: The Awakening): Alter Conductivity (p. 194), Influence Light (p. 162), Invisible Object (p. 166) or Transmute Water (p. 197). The mage also studies physics, alchemy and philosophy during this training period.</div><div>The mentor may terminate training at any time if he feels the pupil isn’t cut out for the Legacy. At the end of the training time, the mentor makes a decision as to whether the pupil is a good match. If he feels the mage will be a good addition to the Legacy, the two of them go on a trip to Sagres, visit the grave of Prince Henry, and discuss the philosophy of reaching for the stars. That evening, the mage reshapes his soul and formally becomes a Celestial Master.</div>",

This Attainment requires a flat space and a good source of energy (light, sound, energy or fire will all suffice, but the simplest method is probably to use this Attainment during the day and use sunlight). The mage must have a sympathetic connection to a nearby object. He enters a trance, meditating upon the object and all of the energy and matter in between himself and it. As he mediates, the energy source becomes a solid, 3-D model of the terrain between the mage and the targeted object. The model only records stationary objects, so people and moving cars aren’t recorded, but the level of detail is otherwise superb (street signs are visible, swimming pools are actually full of water, and so on). The scale of the model is roughly 60:1, so a five-foot object is about an inch high on the model.</div><div>This Attainment requires a point of Mana and an extended action.

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>HISTORY</h2><div>The Illumined Path claims a long history as a faction, but only recently became a Legacy. As far back as the Reformation, certain mages worked closely within the Church (and outside of it, probably, but the most reliable records come from priests and monks) to help “illuminate” the souls of the un-Awakened. These mages variously called themselves “guides,” “muses,” and sometimes even “Prometheans,” after the Greek Titan who brought fire to mortals (this title is almost never used in the modern era).</div><div>The Illumined Path adopted its name and a formal set of precepts in the early 20th century. A Lutheran priest began the journey to Awakening, but faltered somewhere along the way and wound up trapped within his own mystery play. A Thyrsus mage called Daniel, using a protracted Spirit spell, found his lost soul and brought it back to his body. The priest remembered little of the experience, but did recall seeing “a light, a beckoning light that led me back.” After that, he was able to see magic without succumbing to Disbelief, and became a trusty ally of Daniel’s cabal. The cabal, in fact, dedicated themselves to helping other Sleepers see past the Lie. The priest acted as spiritual counselor and advisor to the mages, and it was he who provided the phrase that has since defined the Illumined Path: “To give light to those who sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death” (Luke 1:79).</div><div>The cabal never referred to itself as “the Illumined Path.” Instead, that phrase referred to their set of philosophical and magical precepts (see below). Over time, Daniel and the rest of the cabal learned that Sleepers were capable of seeing magic and Supernal Truth more often than most mages gave them credit for. The un-Awakened normally didn’t understand what they were seeing, but they responded instinctively to threats even when they couldn’t identify the source. The cabal felt that this kind of instinct was what granted humanity an inherent sense of morality. People knew that hurting others was “wrong” because they perceived the inherent harmony of the universe and wanted to be part of it. Those who were willing to hurt others, or, worse, took pleasure in it, did so because they were especially blinded by Quiescence.</div><div>But then the cabal received a fatal blow to its philosophy — World War I. Daniel, a young man at the time that war broke out, entered the Army hoping to spread his teachings to soldiers on both sides. Instead, he met his end in France, gunned down in a muddy field. His magic was no match for machine gun fire. Back in the United States, his cabal read the reports of what was happening in Europe, and fell to despair. People, it seemed, had no sense of peace or harmony, or if they did, it was quickly eroded when the trumpets of war sounded.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Revival</h3><div>It was Daniel’s grand-nephew, Graham Benedine, who revived the Illumined Path in 1982. Graham found Daniel’s Bible while rummaging through a box in his mother’s attic one day. He sat down and read the notes that Daniel had written to himself, took note of the underlined passages, and marveled at the strange symbols that were not English, and yet seemed to mean something, though Graham could not put his finger on what it was. Never a particularly religious man, Graham was still fascinated by his great-uncle, the philosopher, and made a list of the notes Daniel had written and the passages he’d marked, in order. What he discovered, with a little interpretation, was the Illumined Path.</div><div>Graham, of course, knew nothing of Awakened magic, but he saw the philosophy as meaningful anyway. Enlightenment, as he read it, was something that couldn’t be given, but could benefit from guidance. The Illumined Path rejected notions of preaching, or a master-student relationship, and instead summed up its position with a parable:</div><div><i>We are all lost in a dark wood. Sometimes, one of us finds the edge, and is free and safe. That man then has the choice: does he leave the rest of us to our fate? Does he feel it is our responsibility to find our own way? Does he lie in wait, hoping to trap us for his own benefit? Or does he re-enter the woods, hoping to guide us out?</i></div><div><i>Likewise, some of us lost here have light. Do we hide our light, selfishly guarding it? Are we so afraid that others will stomp it out, out of fear, out of hate, out of desperation? No. Our lights must lead others on, for light begets light. Once others are drawn to us, we must show them how to light their own way. This is the Illumined Path.</i></div><div>Graham wrote a book entitled “The Illumined Path,” espousing his great-uncle’s philosophies. It was published, but never sold very well. The Legacy, of course, uses Graham’s book as their bible.</div><div>Graham never Awakened, and died in 1990. Officially, his death was of natural causes, but the Legacy believes he was murdered by magic, probably by the Seers of the Throne (but, some speculate, just as easily by the Guardians of the Veil). Shortly after his death, a group of mages (mostly Shamans) who had read and been inspired by his book came together and formed a cabal. A few years later, the Legacy was born. The Illumined Path has refused to name the first member of the Legacy. When asked who the founder of the Illumined Path is, they refer to the unnamed priest whom Daniel guided out of the “dark wood” so many years ago.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Philosophy</h3><div>The Legacy’s philosophy, as explained by Daniel and later Graham, is as follows:</div><ul><li><b>Varying degrees of light:</b> One is not “Awakened” or “Asleep.” The ability to perceive magic is a spectrum. A “Sleepwalker” is in the middle of the spectrum, a mage is closer to one extreme, but a “Sleeper” can be led to enlightenment (if not Awakening), and a mage can be led to great insight.</li><li><b>Lead, do not preach:</b> There is no value in abusive teaching. The Guides do not beat their students, and they do not put them through demeaning or hurtful lessons. The world teaches pain and suffering enough, and the Legacy’s members do not wish to make it worse.</li><li><b>The soul is the brightest light:</b> A person who has damaged his soul must be healed. A mage that traffics in souls is the worst kind of blasphemer and traitor to the Light. And yet, if his soul can be healed, that is the greatest good.</li><li><b>Recognize the moment of the spark:</b> Any Sleeper can be made into a Sleepwalker — or even Awakened — by witnessing magic at the right moment. This moment might be defined by crisis, introspection, or even random chance, but if a Pathfinder can show a Sleeper something magical, be it a vulgar spell, an Artifact, or even a supernatural occurrence unconnected with Awakened magic, she can open that Sleeper’s soul to a bit more light.</li><li><b>Master Paradox:</b> Mages can prevent Paradox with magic. They can cope with the results, but the damage it can do to their bodies is great. The Illumined Path feels that allowing Paradox to eat away at their bodies is wrong. Every mage must make his own choice about Paradox, but fear of it only empowers it.</li></ul><div>This last tenet is one that the Legacy argues about even today. Daniel, apparently, was notorious for letting Paradox run free, and wound up Branded more than once. Some suspect, in fact, that a Paradox was what killed him on the battlefield. The Illumined Path feels that releasing Paradox, rather than containing it, is generally preferable. It’s just not always practical, especially in a combat situation.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Induction </h3><div>Joining the Illumined Path is nominally a matter of reading Graham’s book and dedicating oneself to the philosophies therein, which means anyone, even a Sleeper, can do it. Joining the actual Legacy is a little more involved, of course. Once the supplicant has read the book, she must seek out a tutor and present her request. Thus far, only Thyrsus mages have joined the Legacy, but no specific policy on the part of the Illumined Path restricts it to Shamans.</div><div>If the tutor agrees to take on the pupil (and the tutor is left to his own devices for determining suitability), the apprenticeship usually takes a month or two. During this time, the tutor and student find ways to extend guidance to others, hopefully in a way that makes Sleepers more aware of magic without violating the Lex Magica. Often this involves interacting with mortals on a spiritual level and helping to foster perception of the unseen. Sometimes, it involves dealing with mortals who have already witnessed something supernatural and avoiding a violent response.</div><div>Some Guides take a more martial approach, however, and spend their time hunting down mages and other beings that work to stifle constructive understanding of the magical world. Banishers and Tremere Liches are favorite targets, though the Legacy does sometimes come into conflict (normally non-violent) with the Guardians of the Veil as well.</div><div>Whenever the tutor feels it appropriate, he aids the new Guide in reshaping her soul and joining the Legacy. The initiation ceremony is usually performed with Sleepers and Sleepwalkers present, even if this means it must take place under the guise of another such ritual (such as a baptism).</div>",

Most of humanity, therefore, chooses not to see the magic right before them. That might work as a defense mechanism, but it’s not getting the human race anywhere in terms of enlightenment, and so the Illumined Path works to keep its charges safe while still guiding them.

        "descrizione": "<div>The odd Legacy known as Mimir’s Voice has a strange set of inspirations for their philosophies. They look to figures both historical and mythological as their teachers: Mimir, whose severed head advised Odin; William Rankine, the Scottish physicist who coined the term “potential energy;” and Lao Tzu, the Chinese Taoist philosopher. The Advisors, as they are often known, concern themselves with gathering knowledge, with learning everything they can, but with acting in accordance with their instincts and intuition. Often, that means not acting, because hesitation is a sign that not enough is yet known.</div><div>Members of the Legacy are unfailingly polite, sometimes to the point of passivity. They operate under a strict code of non-aggression (not necessarily non-violence, however), and the vows of the Legacy preclude turning aside someone that asks for their help. The vows also preclude lying, however, and this places the Legacy at risk should a Sleeper ever ask a question with a potentially damaging answer. When asked about this, an Advisor admits that the best solution is simply to avoid being faced with those kinds of questions. The Voice must be prepared to face consequences from either the mortal law or the Lex Magica, if keeping her vows means violating those laws.</div><div>Above all, Mimir’s Voice strives to help others — mage and Sleeper alike — learn. But teaching isn’t a matter of explanation and lecture, not if one wants the lesson to sink in. Ask any teacher; the only lesson a student really learns is the one that he wants to learn, and so education is less about presenting fact and more about instilling a desire to become knowledgeable and an understanding of how to learn. The Legacy, therefore, amasses knowledge and waits to be asked for it. The Advisor is potential energy, and that energy is knowledge, magic, and even moral guidance.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Advisors",
        "orders": "As mentioned, the Mysterium boasts the greatest number of Advisors, but this has more to do with the founder of the Legacy being a mystagogue than the Legacy’s beliefs fitting neatly into the order. The members of the order share stories of the quiet, somewhat strange mages of the Voice, and occasionally someone hears of it and decides it would be a good fit. The Free Council also has a few Advisors among its members, as the Legacy’s modern origins and interest in energy, to say nothing of its altruistic and egalitarian views, make it attractive to the youngest order.<div>The Adamantine Arrow appreciates the Legacy’s desire to help and serve others, but sees it as a bit too pacifistic, in general. That said, the Taoist elements of the Legacy’s philosophy appeal to some of the gentler members of the order, and it’s not impossible to find an Advisor in the Arrow.</div><div>The Guardians of the Veil has nothing against the Advisors in principle, but the openness of its members and their refusal to lie concern the order. Being willing to help anyone who asks is laudable, yes, but if in helping a person the mage reveals the Mysteries to a Sleeper or inadvertently furthers the machinations of the Seers...well, the Guardians aren’t comfortable with that kind of blind, rather pie-eyed generosity. The Advisors, of course, feel that says much about the Guardians and the way they train their members.</div><div>The Silver Ladder, like the Guardians, doesn’t object to the Advisors, but usually the Ladder would rather see others in an advisory role. That said, at least one member of the Vox Draconis, upon joining the Legacy and adopting its philosophies, found that the pressures of leadership were much reduced when he wasn’t trying to push the Consilium, but rather responding to its needs.</div>",
        "appearance": "Members of the Legacy dress and behave as their intuition drives them, but the Advisors are not lazy, and so they are typically well-groomed and clean. That doesn’t mean that they are neat or formal, however. One member of the Legacy might dress in poet’s shirts and wear his hair long, while another dresses conservatively and sits quietly, unnoticed, until someone asks for her. Most Advisors attempt to remain nondescript, but find that the simplest method of doing this is to act natural; a mage that looks like she belongs where she is doesn’t raise eyebrows.",
        "background": "A member of Mimir’s Voice can come from anywhere, but characters with highly traumatized pasts don’t tend to fit in well. A mage is required to have a certain degree of peace with herself, as is a great deal of maturity and humility, before she can be a successful Advisor. As such, mages who revel in their power, mages that casually use magic and mages that are driving, aggressive forces in their orders, cabals or Consilii usually don’t bother.<div>Teachers, sensei and other educators make superb Advisors, provided they are in the business for the right reasons. Someone who became a teacher to get summers off might as well not bother. One of the main goals of the Legacy is to help others learn, and this goal requires that the mage be able to look beyond her own needs.</div>",
        "organizzation": "The Legacy doesn’t have the numbers for formal organization, though mentor and pupil normally keep in touch, and therefore it’s not uncommon for a mage to have met his mentor’s mentor. Since the Legacy is so open, though, and since almost every member has some proficiency with Space magic (being a Mastigos Legacy), finding a given member is usually just a matter of knowing a name and casting a spell. Within a Consilium, an Advisor is likely to take an assistive role, perhaps acting as Herald or, within the Mysterium, as Censor or assistant to the Censor. Advisors might rise in Consilium Status without trying to, as other mages come to them for advice or help. Advisors also often wind up knowing things that the other people wish they did not, and since they don’t keep secrets, the Voice ends up on the wrong end of assassination attempts more frequently than they’d like. Fortunately, their Attainments help to keep them alive and help others learn (see below).",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>Mimir’s Voice is a relatively new Legacy — appropriate, given its eclectic selection of philosophical inspirations. The first member of the Legacy was a Warlock of the Mysterium named Elle. Elle was offered the position of Censor in her city’s Consilium, and accepted, but was surprised at how much effort the mages of the city seemed to put into making sure that she kept certain facts from their rivals. After a year in the position, she announced her policy — she would never deny information to anyone who asked, but she would not offer information under any circumstances. She remained in sight (and effectively became second-in-command to the Hierarch, though she would never have referred to herself as such), but largely remained silent. Asking her for advice was a good way to draw attention to oneself, because then other mages became interested in what the querent wanted to know... and Elle refused to keep secrets. The atmosphere of transparency created in the Consilium was beneficial, for a while, but Elle died mysteriously after three years in her position. During that time, she had passed along her new Legacy. She never named it, but her pupil, a young man named Gjallarhorn (after the drinking horn that Odin used to drink from Mimir’s well), viewed the Legacy as the perfect advisors, and chose the name according to his own sensibilities. Unfortunately, he lacked his mentor’s patience and her unwavering commitment to honesty, and before long he was keeping secrets for some people and providing private information on others. The Consilium suffered a collapse from the infighting, during which many of the older mages left the area, and has only now begun to recover (Gjallarhorn now acts as Hierarch for the area).</div><div>Mimir’s Voice spreads slowly, and enjoys its largest membership within the Mysterium. It is not strictly an order Legacy, however, and some Consilii (mostly surrounding the one that bore witness to the rise and fall of Elle and Gjallarhorn) are home to a quiet, polite and extremely approachable Advisor. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Joining Mimir’s Voice isn’t easy, but it is faster than many other Legacies. The Voice doesn’t ask for long periods of apprenticeship or extensive testing periods. It does, however, ask that members of the Legacy be morally sound, almost impeccable. A mage attempting to join the Voice must submit to a long interview with many ethical quandaries, as well as magical probing to determine whether the answers she gives are indicative of her true feelings. The interview process is meant to gauge what the mage’s intuition is telling her, and whether those intuitive urges are compatible with the Legacy. A mage whose first thought when faced with a potentially violent situation is to contribute to the violence probably should look elsewhere, but a mage whose first impulse is to defuse the situation is perhaps a better match. Interestingly, a mage who responds with fear to violence is often given preferential treatment, because such a mage is responding in a perfectly appropriate manner. The second part of the question, though, is what action the mage takes.</div><div>No action at all is often an appropriate response. The Legacy often recounts the story of the man who is thrown from a horse, breaking his arm and receiving sympathy from a neighbor...only to discover that because of his injury, he cannot be conscripted into battle where he will surely die. The mages of Mimir’s Voice don’t advocate standing idly by while people suffer, but they do ask their members to recognize that suffering has a place, too. What is acceptable suffering, and when is action — magic — required? Those questions don’t have correct answers, and a mentor in Mimir’s Voice strives to help her pupil consider the question and act with confidence, rather than act rashly.</div><div>The prospective Advisor is admonished to consider her motives in whatever action she takes. Anger, hatred, jealousy and other such emotions are easy to label as “bad,” but the truth is that they are intuitive, just as compassion, love and mercy can be. Indeed, it’s not impossible for an action to be motivated by both envy and compassion, by both justice and anger. And if an action is just, but still motivated by anger, is that action then wrong? Mimir’s Voice believes that action motivated by emotion (“good” or “bad”) isn’t necessarily wrong, but might be diluted. Instead, they advise learning one’s own patterns, learning what kind of “energy” one is storing up, and being self-aware enough to recognize one’s typical reactions.</div><div>Once the interview is over, the Advisor makes a decision. That decision might be to induct the new mage, to refuse her request, or to delay the answer to gather further information. The Advisor might invite the prospect to join her cabal for a short time, or to apprentice with her so that she can observe the character. She might also ask for permission to use Space magic to look in on the mage from time to time, just to see what she does in different situations.</div><div>If the mage is accepted into the Legacy, she is expected to learn and swear to the Code. This oath isn’t magically enforced, because backing it up with a spell would imply that the Code isn’t worth following by itself (and might also back a mage into a corner where the letter of the law is concerned — the letter is much less important than the spirit). The Code isn’t brief and it isn’t simple, but if the mentoring mage has chosen a pupil well, the Code is intuitive.</div><div>Once the mage swears the Code, the mentor shows her how to reshape her soul for the Legacy. Advisors often state that the sensation of becoming a member of Mimir’s Voice is soothing, as though external sound and sensation suddenly dampens or moves far away. They feel energized, but not restless — ready for action, should action become necessary.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Code of Mimir’s Voice</h3><div>The Code isn’t a list of rules and laws, but is a philosophical work composed of parables, examples and maxims. Following is an excerpt:</div><div>Rudeness has no place. If a Voice cannot think of a way to contribute to a conversation, if a Voice cannot conceive of something to say that can teach — and remember that to teach, we must make the pupil want the lesson — then the Voice must be silent....</div><div>Aggression is dangerous. If your intuition says to attack, consider why? Who benefits from your injury? If you die, what will you leave behind? If you kill, what then? What have you removed from the world? If you choose non-aggression, protecting where protection is needed but abstaining from violent action otherwise, you are better assured of remaining unblemished....</div><div>In casting spells, remember that your intuition guides the magic as much as your will. Witness the mage whose Nimbus flares to life and scours the ground around him with fire or ice or acid or harsh words or hatred. What is that mage’s intuition? Is it an extension of the hate in his heart? What is in your heart, and what does your magic reveal about you? If you act in harmony with your intuition, if you train your intuition to guide you well, you can ease the world in its myriad transitions, rather than change it with a jarring, aggressive push....</div><div>If someone comes to you and asks for your help, grant it. Do not waste time determining if this person deserves your help. You might be able to make that determination by looking into the person’s mind or soul, yes, but by doing so, you are cheapening their request for your aid. Asking for help is a monumental act of trust, and you should always honor that. If, in helping this person, it comes to your attention that the person is a criminal or a monster, you must act as your intuition guides you. If your intuition tells you not to help someone who asks, though, consider why. Is the person lying about why he needs the help? If so, help him anyway, and your example will show him that not everyone sees the world as he does. Is the person trying to harm you or find a way to rob you? If so, help him anyway, and keep your wits about you, always ready to escape or protect yourself, for you, as a mage, are able to protect yourself and another victim might not be. Is the person asking you for help solely because he knows you will grant it without question? Help him, and rejoice, for you are living the Code.</div><div>Mages living by the Code often have high Wisdom ratings, usually 7 or more. Of course, not every Advisor lives strictly by the Code, and some feel that paying attention to intuition means knowing when to ignore the Code. This attitude is not at all in line with Elle’s philosophies, but Elle is gone, and so her words are subject to interpretation.</div>",

Magic, then, is the potential energy stored within a mage that can be released as “kinetic energy” — a spell — at a moment’s notice.</div><div>The Attainments of the Legacy are also protective in nature. This is both because of the Legacy’s proclivity for helping others, and because the Advisors often wind up learning secrets about others and having to protect themselves against those who would rather keep those secrets quiet.</div>",

While this Attainment doesn’t provide true invisibility, it does make light and sound “slide off” the mage. Viewers tend to look past the Advisor, rather than at her, or be easily distracted by nearby sounds.</div><div>In game terms, this spell combines several low-level Forces effects with the Mind spell “Incognito Presence.” The character can activate this Attainment whenever she wishes; the player simply rolls Composure + Stealth + Forces (instant action). The Attainment remains active for one scene, but can be reactivated as necessary. While Blind Spot is active, the player receives the 8-again bonus on all Stealth rolls, and any ties in contested rolls made for the character to go unnoticed go to the character, rather than the observer.</div><div>Even if the mage isn’t exactly hiding, people don’t notice her easily. Casual viewers look past her, and as long as she doesn’t move suddenly or attack anyone (which ends the Attainment’s effects), viewers who observe any actions on her part that involve sleight of hand or subtle movements suffer a penalty equal to the mage’s Gnosis rating.</div><div><i><b>Example:</b> Joan, an Advisor, is present at a store robbery. Unwilling to incapacitate the thieves (she doesn’t know why they’re stealing, after all) but feeling it necessary to protect the other bystanders, she slips to the back of the store and opens the emergency exit to let the others escape. Joan activates this Attainment, and the Storyteller has her player roll Dexterity + Stealth to get to the door without being seen. The Storyteller rolls Wits + Composure – 7 (the mage’s Gnosis) for the robber to see what she is doing, and the robber’s successes must exceed the mage’s for him to catch her.</i></div>",

Her placement in the initiative roster doesn’t matter. If the attacker acts on initiative 14 and the mage’s action does not come until initiative 7, the Advisor can still attempt to turn aside the attack.</div><div>The attacker assembles his dice pool as usual, including any modifiers for the target’s Defense or armor. The mage’s player spends one point of Mana and rolls Dexterity + Science + Forces. Every success reduces the attacker’s dice pool by one. The attacker cannot choose not to attack, regardless of how many successes the mage receives. If the attack is reduced to a chance dice, though, a dramatic failure does not harm the attacker, as the attack no longer has any energy at all (the dramatic failure is treated as a normal failure).</div><div><i><b>Example:</b> Joan managed to get most of the shoppers out of the store without being noticed, but as she prepares to leave as well, one of the escaping shoppers yells to a passing cop. One of the thieves notices this and panics, firing wildly out of the store’s windows with an automatic weapon. Joan uses Wasted Potential on the attack, turning aside the energy of the bullets. The Storyteller assembles the robber’s dice pool: 2 (Dexterity) + 2 (Firearms) + 2 (the damage modifier for a small SMG) + 3 (for firing on full auto) = 9 dice. The glass in the window shaves off another dice (8 dice), and the shooter is firing at three targets (5 dice). Joan’s player rolls Dexterity + Science + Forces and comes up with five successes. The shooter’s dice pool is reduced to zero dice — a chance dice. If the Storyteller had spent a Willpower point for the shooter, he’d still have three dice to roll, but it’s too late for that now.

        "descrizione": "<div>Almost every civilization has a “time before” story. Before life was the way it was, there was a paradise, a land of ease and comfort, of beauty and pleasure. And then, usually due to some failing on the part of mankind, it all fell apart, and people were forced to hunt, mate, hurt and die. The fact that this myth is so widespread leads the Awakened to surmise that there must be some truth to it — indeed, they tie these uber-myths to their own story of the Fall of Atlantis. The Celestial Ladder shattered and the Awakened City was lost forever. The Orders of the Pentacle (rather, four of them) claim to be all that remains of this “time before.”</div><div>The Roses of Eden don’t dispute this. They just think it’s pathetic.</div><div>The Roses of Eden are mages that denounce the Pentacle, and the Atlantean paradigm in general. It isn’t that they claim Atlantis never existed — certainly the temples and Artifacts, to say nothing of phenomena such as ananke, indicate that some civilization of mages predated known history. What the Roses object to is basing the current, modern-day society of the Awakened on a society about which so few concrete facts are known. After all, mages are aware that the Seers of the Throne take their orders (or at least inspiration) from ancient, ascended masters — why, then, do the Pentacle mages insist on doing the same thing? Oracles or Exarchs, it doesn’t matter. Both are inscrutable, both are unknowable, and both are not of the Fallen World. Better, surely, to create a new society, one truly born of the modern era.</div><div>The Legacy’s members are aware that their philosophies aren’t popular, and so most of them try to meet other mages’ concerns as reasonably and gently as possible. This is especially true of the Noddists, who once claimed membership in one of the orders but left after the labyrinthine politics and rampant nepotism disillusioned them. Yes, the orders have safeguarded important secrets through the centuries — rotes, magical practices, mudras, mystic items and locations — and those should all be preserved. But isn’t it time to cast off the rivalries of the past?</div><div>Some Noddists, however, are openly hostile to the orders. They might be able to work with order mages, or even to join their cabals, but they refuse to take membership. Some even refuse to claim membership in a Consilium, but most Roses admit that it just isn’t practical to try to make a life as a mage without the protection and support of other mages.</div><div>Perhaps most controversial of all, some Roses cultivate contact with sorcerers whose power doesn’t come from the Supernal Realms at all. Not all magic is Awakened in nature, and while most mages seem to feel that any magic that doesn’t directly stem from an Awakening is an inferior or even stolen version of their own power, the Roses of Eden view all magic as having a place in their ideal society. The Fallen World is a dangerous place, and having allies that don’t suffer Paradox or engender Disbelief can only benefit the Awakened, even if their powers aren’t as versatile. The Roses of Eden haven’t made a great deal of progress toward establishing their society yet, largely because they have thousands of years of Atlantean tradition to break through. In some Consilii (notably those with a heavy Free Council presence), the Roses have succeeded in doing away with some of the tradition offices. Instead of a Hierarch, a visiting cabal might find a Committee, or even a President, elected for a short time by the mages of the city. Rumor has it that one city’s mages even collectively renounced their order membership and pledged themselves to the Roses of Eden. This city (the exact location varies depending on who is telling the tale and why) lost all of its mages over the next six weeks, and now no Consilium at all remains. The more militant Roses of Eden have their theories about what really happened, but the moderate members of the Legacy doubt the veracity of the story.</div>",

Another might take a more tolerant approach and try to bring the system down by exposing it — a reporter, then, might make for a good pupil.<div>As a faction or an ideological movement, the Roses of Eden don’t discriminate.

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'> History</h2><div>The story goes that in Eden, before the fall from grace, roses did not have thorns. After Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge, God laid a curse on Adam that (among other things) plants would have thorns and thistles. Roses, then, developed the sharp thorns that would go on to become metaphors for life in general and for the sorrow that seems to follow happiness.</div><div>This story resonated with an Acanthus mage named Abigail Mitchum who had recently joined the Silver Ladder. During her Awakening to Arcadia, she had seen the possibility of the Wise to earn the title, to delve into mysteries of the past and look to the heart of history’s greatest triumphs and mistakes. The potential to teach, to save and to succor was there, in the Awakened soul of every mage. The Silver Ladder, she was told when she emerged, breathless, from her Awakening, was the society of kings, the shining beacon of....</div><div>This sort of talk continued until she’d pledged herself to the order. But then, slowly but surely, she learned that others didn’t share her idealism. Abigail was a veteran of bureaucracy, both from civil service jobs and academia, and she recognized what she was seeing. The Wise, the Awakened, the all-powerful théarchs, weren’t looking beyond their own interests. They saw status within the orders as a goal in itself. Frustrated, she made friends with members of the other orders, and discovered that it was the same everywhere. Even in the Free Council, which didn’t suffer from the same kind of pettiness, mages still saw clout within their own society as a goal.</div><div>Abigail thought that was absurd. Yes, people have a tendency to seek accolades, and they could still do good things while gaining status. But mage society was artificial, constructed around and in the cracks of Sleeper society as some desperate homage to a time that no living mage could verify, much less remember. Abigail held the Awakened to a higher standard than that, and dramatically left the Silver Ladder. “It’s not enough for her to be a mage,” one of her former colleagues muttered as she left. “She wants to be a superhero.”</div><div>Abigail dropped out of sight and ventured across the world, meeting with order leaders, new cabals, solitary mages and those rare few who exist outside the Atlantean societal structure. She learned that there were other ways of doing magic. Power over the world could come from many sources, not all of them benign. A man’s burning obsession could create life. A witch’s potions could make someone fall in love. A wolf-skin, properly prepared, could allow a man to change into a beast. What Abigail took away from these meetings, aside from a great deal of arcane knowledge, was that either magic infused the Fallen World to a much greater degree than mages understood, or that they just weren’t willing to admit it. And again, Abigail found that unacceptable.</div><div>She returned to her original Consilium five years to the day after she left. She approached the seat of the Hierarch and threw a thornless rose at his feet, and then turned to face the assembled Awakened. “I am the Rose of Eden,” she said, “and I have shed my thorns. Anyone who wants to do so is welcome to find me.”</div><div>A few of the mages in attendance did, in fact, come to see her, but only those on the Path of Thistle have so far joined the Legacy itself. Over the ensuing years, the Roses of Eden have spread out over the world, sometimes working closely with Consilium mages, sometimes shunning them and keeping company with other solitaries and non-Awakened sorcerers.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction </h2><div>Once a prospect has found a potential tutor, she must present her case. Why should she be allowed to join the Legacy? Wanting to keep membership in any of the four Atlantean orders (or “pseudo-Atlantean” orders, as some Roses call them) is grounds for immediate dismissal. Individual Noddists can choose to admit Free Council mages to their ranks, but not all are willing to do so. Only Acanthus mages are permitted to become Roses of Eden.</div><div>The prospect is subjected to lengthy questioning, and all answers are vetted against both mundane and magical investigation. The Roses like to know who they are dealing with. It isn’t that they are afraid of infiltration (they tend to be transparent about their agendas and initiatives), just that they don’t want people grubbing for power within the Legacy. The prospect also needs to present an accounting of what she has done with her life. Has she held down jobs or raised a family, or has she led a life of hedonism and sloth? The Legacy doesn’t disapprove of pleasure, but the Roses can’t abide idleness from mages. Recently Awakened mages, especially those who have careers and families and are still coping with the transition from Sleeping life to Awakened life, are never turned away, even if they can’t actually join the Legacy (due to not being Acanthus or not being magically powerful enough). Such people are given support and mentoring, always with an eye toward building the ideal Awakened society — one in which mages help each other to explore the secrets of the world and protect those who cannot safely look upon those secrets, rather than squirreling them away and sniggering about it.</div><div>The Roses of Eden don’t go in for showy initiation requirements. They see such trials as exactly the sort of thing that mages should be able to rise above. After all, a mage with even the barest knowledge of the Mind or Fate Arcana should know a lie when she hears one. An Apprentice of Time can get a sense as to whether a given prospect will or will not make a good member of the Legacy. Why not put these talents to use, and save the time that would otherwise be wasted in contests of strength, skill or political savvy — talents that can just as easily be bestowed by magic? The gifts of Awakened are nothing without the moral fiber to make good use of them, and if there is a spell to make someone into a reasonable and honest person, the Roses haven’t discovered it yet.</div><div>Once a mage is accepted into the Legacy, she is expected to keep regular contact with her mentor for a period of not less than sixth months. During that time, she is also expected to act in some meaningful way, either to help other mages reinvent their society, help Sleepers combat the evils of their society, or find mages and other magic users outside the Atlantean power structure and enlist their help, or at least their knowledge. All of these can be dangerous jobs, and the Roses of Eden make no bones about it — they do not enjoy the same support that other mages do. “But,” Abigail always says when this is pointed out to her, “give the Roses time to bloom.”</div>",

        "firstAttainmentDescription": "<div>Make no mistake — being a Rose of Eden places a mage in danger. Some Consilii regard the Legacy as nothing less than a terrorist organization, and it’s not unknown for assassins to target the Noddists, especially the ones that seem to make some headway (ironically, the loud, hyper-critical Roses are the easiest to ignore, and seldom get selected for termination). In any event, after the third attempt by the Guardians of the Veil to silence her, Abigail developed a spell allowing her to sense minute changes in plant life around her. This enabled her to sense assassins coming before they could drive in the knife, and, surprisingly, even warned her of magical attacks. The plant kingdom, it seems, responds to shifts in the flow of Mana in ways that animals (humans included) can’t fathom.</div><div>In game terms, this Attainment is always active and mimics the effects of both “Pulse of the Living World” and “Analyze Life” (p. 181 and 180 of Mage: The Awakening, respectively). The character thus always has an active Mage Sight, and can, with a reflexive Intelligence + Science or Animal Ken roll, know the age, sex and species of a living thing. This also has the handy effect of detecting when something is not alive, which is useful for sniffing out undead creatures, something Abigail used to great effect when looking for vampiric sorcerers.</div><div>In addition, the mage is constantly tuned in to the minute shifts in the patterns of life around her. In game terms, this adds two dice to any reaction to surprise roll (see p. 46 of the World of Darkness Rulebook). If the character has the Danger Sense Merit (p. 108 of the World of Darkness Rulebook), both of these bonuses apply.</div>",

Abigail noted early in her campaign that if she looked well-rested and hale, her audiences, be they mage, Sleeper or stranger beings still, received her politely and with more respect. This Attainment allows a Noddist to appear perpetually healthy, with the bonus of allowing her to heal damage to her body more quickly into the bargain, by combining her knowledge of plant life with her ability to heal herself.</div><div>The mage can reflexively heal all bashing damage once per scene, no matter how much she has taken or whether or not she has any more severe wounds. In addition, she can spend one point of Mana to downgrade any lethal damage on her Health chart to bashing damage. Finally, if she suffers enough lethal damage to starting bleeding to death (see p. 173 of the World of Darkness Rulebook), she automatically spends a point of Mana and stabilizes herself. She is still unconscious, but is in no danger of dying unless she takes more damage.</div><div>To use any of these powers, however, the character must either be in direct sunlight or be able to touch bare earth. The earth must be able to sustain plant life. Even a houseplant is enough, but if the character is in a city alleyway at night, she might have trouble using this Attainment.</div>",
        "secondAttainmentOptArcana": "Prime 3",
        "secondAttainmentOptDescrizione": "<div>A Rose of Eden who is also a Disciple of Prime can grow a true tree of life. The tree needs to be of a variety that bears fruit, and it must be grown without magical assistance (that is, the character must tend and water it normally). The mage must plant the tree herself, though a sapling works just as well as a seed. When the tree bears fruit, the fruits carry within them the power to heal. Anyone who eats the fruit of the tree is immediately healed of damage equal to the mage’s Gnosis, in either bashing or lethal damage. If the mage has Life 4, the fruits can heal aggravated damage as well.</div><div>Although the mage cannot use Life magic to speed the growth of the tree, she can use any mundane method she wishes to speed up its growth. Abigail Mitchum was known to tend an apple tree using this Attainment, but she also grew tomato plants in her basement using hydroponics. The tomatoes worked just as well for healing as the apples.</div><div>The mage must infuse the tree or plant with one point of Mana per day to allow the plant to soak up the necessary magic. Water infused with Tass is acceptable, and some Roses have even been known to infuse plant food tablets with Mana to feed their magical trees. If a plant goes more than three days without a point of Mana, it loses the ability to function as a Tree of Life until infused with a full month’s worth of Mana.</div>",
        "thirdAttainmentName": "Tree of Knowledge",
        "thirdAttainmentPrerequisites": "Gnosis 7, Life 4",
        "thirdAttainmentDescription": "<div>“Awakening is the act of eating of the Tree of Knowledge,” Abigail Mitchum liked to say. “We listened to the Serpent, no matter what form he wore at the time, and we took a big bite. That’s not the Fall. The Fall was assuming that eating that fruit meant we knew something that other folks didn’t, and could never know.” Abigail felt, especially after her travels, that the Fall of Atlantis was relevant only insofar as it provided a good model of what not to do. Arrogance, elitism and pride were the enemies, and sectarianism and divisiveness were what strengthened those things. The Tree of Knowledge, she came to feel, was not dangerous because it revealed, but dangerous because knowledge itself was dangerous. Knowledge could paralyze or divide just as easily as it could teach or heal. And Abigail, never one for inaction, decided she would show people the unity that knowledge could provide. This Attainment was the result.</div><div>Those mages who have experienced the Tree of Knowledge Attainment describe the feeling as extremely unsettling. The Attainment requires that all participants touch, skin to skin (holding hands is the usual method, though more intimate versions have been known to occur). The mage then uses the Attainment to make slight alterations in the Pattern of all of the participants, changing animal matter to plant matter on a cellular level. The result is an increased awareness of one another’s state of being and an ability to understand one another, which lasts for the duration of the scene. The participants all feel a sudden dulling of sensation from sound and sight, but experience a kind of synesthesia — they feel light rather than seeing it. Also, perception of difference between people fades, not to visual perception, but to cognitive association. That is, participants notice details like race, size, age and so on, but do not attach much meaning to them.</div><div>In game terms, the player rolls Presence + Empathy + Life. Any character that wishes to resist can roll Resolve + Gnosis, contesting the mage’s roll. If the mage succeeds, all participants gain an immediate sense of the physical health of everyone involved, similar to the Life spell “Healer’s Trance.” In addition, the characters become passive and incapable of violence against one another for the duration of the scene, though they are capable of defending themselves against outside threats (any combat rolls made by participants during this scene suffer a –1 modifier, though). Finally, participants become linked on a deep and primal level for a short time. Reactions to surprise are made collectively — as long as one player succeeds, none of the others are surprised. Also, the participants can disperse injury among them, potentially ignoring it altogether. Two participants can absorb a point of bashing damage, five can absorb a point of lethal damage, and eight can absorb a point of aggravated damage.</div><div><i>Example: A Rose of Eden uses Tree of Knowledge to link a cabal of mages and their Sleepwalker servants — seven people in total (five mages, including the Noddist, and two Sleepwalkers). As they are growing accustomed to their new awareness, a trio of Seers of the Throne attacks the cabal. One Seer takes a baseball bat to one of the mages and inflicts three levels of bashing damage. Every two people linked by the Tree of Knowledge absorb one point of bashing damage, however, so none of the damage gets through (all seven of the participants wince a bit, but no injury occurs). Another Seer stabs a Sleepwalker for four points of lethal damage. Since it takes five participants to absorb a point of lethal damage, only one point is absorbed. The participants distribute the other three; three characters each suffer one point of lethal damage. Finally, the last Sleeper casts a destructive spell that inflicts two points of aggravated damage to the Noddist. Since only seven people are linked by the Tree, this damage cannot be absorbed, but it can be distributed so that the mage doesn’t have to suffer both (or any) damage.</i></div>",
        "thirdAttainmentOptArcana": "Prime 4",
        "thirdAttainmentOptDescrizione": "<div>If the mage also possesses Prime 4, two additional effects occur when she links a group with the Tree of Knowledge. First, the participants all enjoy the benefits of “Supernal Vision” for the scene, even if they are Sleepers. Second, all participants become resistant to outside magic. Any spell that targets one member of the group suffers a modifier as though trying to target all of them. This modifier is applied whether or not the mage would actually be capable of affecting all of the participants.</div></div><div><i>Example: Continuing with the above example, one of the Seers tries using the Death spell “Enervation” on the Rose of Eden. The Seer only has Death 4, and so is not capable of casting the spell at sensory range (and thus cannot affect all seven targets at once). Nevertheless, the roll suffers a –6 penalty as though the mage were trying to work in Target factors to affect the whole group (and this is in addition to any magical armor that the Noddist character might have!).</i></div>"

        "descrizione": "<div>The Whipping Boys appear to be a shallow Legacy, using magic to experience pain for sexual gratification purposes without some of the messy after effects. Life magic, the Legacy’s forte, is used to heal the body after long nights of consensual abuse. The Whipping Boys are entrenched in the Sleeper S&M culture, and as such ride close to some seedier practices (especially in the World of Darkness). Given that, other, more conservative mages tend to regard them as freaks or perverts. But the Whipping Boys, beneath their hedonistic ways, have a deeply spiritual side, and roots in ecstatic traditions the world over.</div><div>The Whipping Boys believe that through extreme suffering and sensation, a person can reach a place in which the soul is unfettered, unconstrained by any part of the body. The consciousness can then be reshaped, so it’s important to enter into the experience with a clear goal. Most of the time, the Whipping Boys use the practice as a way to focus and refine their use of the Dream Merit, but the “Session,” as its called in the Legacy, is also the method by which members advance. In addition, the Whipping Boys claim that a Sleeper who undergoes the Session and remains conscious can reach the Supernal Realms and Awaken.</div><div>The Whipping Boys learn and, more importantly, teach, through suffering. Even a mage with no connection to the BDSM culture might find enlightenment — and the beginning or end of the Hanged Man phase of the Tarot journey — in a Session. Of course, that involves moving past the initial feelings of disgust or discomfort, or even homophobia, experienced by the mage.</div>",
        "alternateNickname": "Ecstatics or, less kindly, Perverts",
        "orders": "Theurgists of any order can learn the Legacy, but the Whipping Boys have the greatest foothold in the Adamantine Arrow of the west coast. While some Arrow cabals look at the Whipping Boys as hedonists and freaks, others see their point. Pain can lead to enlightenment, and no one can deny the effectiveness of the Whipping Boys in a fight. Ecstatic never intended his Legacy to be peaceful. He was always spoiling for a fight, and he keenly encourages members of the Arrow (of any Path) to undergo the Session, even if they choose not to join.<div>Opinions from the other orders vary, of course. The Guardians of the Veil has used S&M culture as a labyrinth occasionally, and so doesn’t object to a Legacy in place there, provided it’s something they can use. They also appreciate any practice that makes members able to withstand (or employ) torture. Unfortunately, the few Guardian Obrimos who have joined the Legacy return to their order refusing to use their newfound skills to harm others. “That’s not the point,” they say.</div><div>The Mysterium and the Silver Ladder don’t much care for the Legacy, but again, individual cabals might be more tolerant, depending on their mores. The Mysterium recognizes the long-standing tradition of using pain and sensation to find wisdom, but they find that reading about it and actually being hung upside down and beaten with bronze rods are two different things. The Silver Ladder, on the other hand, finds the whole thing a bit kinky (which doesn’t necessarily mean they don’t participate).</div><div>The Free Council doesn’t always get the philosophical side right away, but being the order most closely tied in to modern Sleeper society, they often have a better sense of the culture from which the Legacy came. The order itself doesn’t have any problem with the Whipping Boys, and more mages from the Legacy come from this order than any other, apart from the Arrow.</div>",
        "appearance": "Some Whipping Boys wear their allegiance on their sleeves, dressing in leathers and covered in body piercings and so on, but most of them blend into whatever society they move in. While an outsider might expect scars and other marks, the Ecstatics normally heal any damage that might come from a Session. They usually aren’t interested in bearing scars from their enlightenment (although sometimes it’s fun to show off).",
        "background": "Despite the name, the Legacy includes both men and women. Female members sometimes refer to themselves as “Whipping Girls,” but just as often use the title “Whipping Boys” to refer to the Legacy as a whole and use the sobriquet “Ecstatic” when referring to themselves. The Legacy takes much of its membership from the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender cultures of California, and from the rest of the world, as the Legacy spreads, but this has more to do with its outspokenly gay founder than a policy on the Whipping Boys’ part.<div>Theoretically, a Whipping Boy can come from any background, provided he can achieve enlightenment through the Session. In practice, this requires that the supplicant be physically fit, socially liberal (intolerant people don’t tend to get invited to undergo the Session) and psychologically strong. Beyond that, a Whipping Boy might choose anyone to go under his tools.</div>",
        "organizzation": "The Legacy is very intimate. Members in the same area know one another, and it’s not uncommon to see cabals of Whipping Boys rather than several cabals all containing a member. Ecstatic stays abreast of what’s happening to the Legacy as best he can, and the members meet annually in San Francisco, often under the guise of a pride parade or street fair. During the rest of the year, the Whipping Boys maintain online discussions and share information through the Internet. A member of the Legacy traveling to a strange city can usually find lodging or hospitality with another member, but this gets chancier as one travels to more conservative or rural areas, or to cities without much of an S&M scene.",

        "historySocietyCulture": "<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>The Whipping Boys began as a cabal in California. The leader, a brash and hot-headed Obrimos named Steven Babbit (he changed his Shadow Name often, but always chose something offensive — past Shadow Names included Bitch, Faggot, Kike, and Queer), fell into a bout of depression following the death of his lover. Wandering the streets of San Francisco, he found a fetish bar he’d never heard of. He entered, walked into a private room, and told the master on duty to kill him. He backed up that request with a magical command, using Life magic to bring out a killing instinct in the man.</div><div>Over the next six hours, Steven discovered a place that was past pain, past suffering, bleeding, and even pleasure. At the end of the ordeal, as he hung upside down, bleeding and scarred, flesh burned from elecrodes, he found enlightenment. He realized that the sensation the body could endure had limits, but that once those limits were surpassed — not just surpassed, but ignored — the mind could be free, even for a short while.</div><div>He left that morning as the sun rose, and took a new Shadow Name: Ecstatic.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Forming the New Legacy</h3><div>Ecstatic was an Adamantine Arrow, but had never been serious about the order before. He enjoyed their training in martial arts and magical combat, but was more interested in sexual exploits than in the order’s service-oriented mentality. After his enlightenment, though, he was desperate to share what he’d learned, and so contacted his old mentor, an Arrow Thyrsus named Breaker. The two of them discussed what Ecstatic had experienced, and Breaker felt that the younger mage was on the verge of reshaping his soul without help, becoming the founder of a new Legacy. Ecstatic, who had never been very clear on how this process worked anyway, spoke with other mages who belonged to Legacies and realized that the ordeal he had gone through had left him raw, naked and broken down. That was perfect for the kind of soul-change necessary for a Legacy, but it also meant he would have to do it again.</div><div>He went back to the site of the club, but all he found was a boarded-up building. Confused, he asked one of his cabal-mates to check the building’s past, but all she found was echoes of music and moans of pleasure. Clearly, this place had been used for sex at some point, but not nearly as recently as Ecstatic had claimed. Ecstatic theorized that he had dreamed it all, that his experience had been a kind of second Awakening. He called on an acquaintance, a Mastigos named Minerva, and asked her to hurt him and not to stop for any reason. Minerva combined magic with her ministrations, and the experience very nearly killed Ecstatic. But hours later, he lay there bleeding once again... and rose, wounds healing, feeling stronger than ever. He had become the first of a new Legacy, and he wished to spread its philosophies.</div><div>Ecstatic’s cabal fractured after this point. Most of them had no desire to undertake a task like joining a Legacy. They were content to party and use their talents for self-gratification. Some, though, stayed with their former leader, and joined the Adamantine Arrow and then the Legacy, which took the name of the cabal as its title. Word spread throughout the Consilii of California of the “S&M Legacy,” and it became a kind of joke for a while (“S&M Legacy? Where from?” “’Frisco, of course.”). But every so often, a mage with an interest in pain, either for the purposes of enlightening or simple pleasure, came to find Ecstatic and his people. Slowly, the Legacy spreads out from the California coast.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Joining the Legacy requires searching out a current member and stating the desire to join. The established Whipping Boys evaluate the supplicant, but the Legacy doesn’t take on many pupils. The Legacy is very intimate (see Organization, below), and so new recruits are more often drawn from friends and lovers of a member, rather than strangers. That said, if the chemistry is right, the Whipping Boys might at least agree to a Session just to see what the supplicant is made of.</div><div>“Session” is the rather euphemistic title the Legacy uses for its hours-long ordeals of sensory overload. Although pain is a large part of it, Whipping Boys also use pleasurable stimulus (though never actual sex) to bring the supplicant into the desired state. Different members of the Legacy employ different methods — electricity, fire, cutting, whipping, pin-pricks and extremes of cold and heat are all possibilities. The mages aren’t above using magic to achieve effects that no Sleeper master could hope for, and, likewise, the Whipping Boys generally keeps a healing spell ready (hung using Time magic, if possible — see p. 260 of Mage: The Awakening) in case things get too far out of hand. But apart from a real threat to the supplicant’s life, the Session doesn’t stop until the supplicant reaches enlightenment. “The safe word is Paradox,” is a common phrase in the Legacy. It means that only something as powerful as the Abyss can stop the Session.</div><div>Once the Session ends, the supplicant is left alone to contemplate. Sometimes, the supplicant decides this Legacy isn’t for him after all. Sometimes, though, the supplicant realizes that in that moment of formless perfection, past the pain and the clamps and the tools, there is a beautiful moment of peace and clarity. Those are the mages that the Legacy accepts.</div>",
        "magic": "",
        "attainmentsDescrizione": "<div>The Attainments of the Whipping Boys are designed to make best use of the moment of clarity that comes after the Session. As such, they build on the body’s responses to pain as well as the immense wealth of knowledge and insight in the unfettered consciousness.</div><div>Not all members of the Legacy have the Dream Merit, but most of them develop it after joining. The Session leaves the mind in a perfect state to gain access to the universal body of knowledge. In game terms, when a Whipping Boy uses the Session to activate the Dream Merit, the player adds the character’s Gnosis rating to the roll for the Merit.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Session</h3><div>Successfully undergoing the Session requires that the character move past pain and even bodily sensation, becoming completely open to his own mind. How, though, do you represent that in game terms?</div><div>It might not be necessary to do so. The character’s mentor is, presumably, skilled enough to bring the character through the Session inflicting little actual injury on him. Likewise, a lover or master with whom the character is very familiar probably knows him well enough to push the right buttons, so to speak, without really hurting him.</div><div>If, however, you need to know if the character reaches the state of enlightenment at the end of the Session (perhaps time is a factor), you can use the following system. The Session is an extended action. It is also a teamwork action (see p. 134 of the World of Darkness Rulebook) in which the Whipping Boy is the primary actor. The character administering the pain is the secondary actor. Unlike most teamwork actions, in this case the two characters have different dice pools. The secondary actor’s player rolls Dexterity + Wits, while the Whipping Boy’s player rolls Wits + Composure. Each roll requires 30 minutes of “work,” and the target number of successes is (the character’s Stamina + Resolve + 10). If the character also has the Iron Stamina Merit, those dots are also added to the total number of successes required. A mage with sufficient dots in the Life Arcanum can use the Degrading the Form spell (p. 186 of Mage: The Awakening) to make it easier on himself.</div><div>The character suffers one point of bashing damage for every 30 minutes of the Session, and does not heal while it is still going on. Wound penalties do not apply to the character’s roll, however.</div>",

Later in the fight, Ecstatic gets stabbed for two points of lethal damage and decides to respond in kind.

This can be done reflexively, especially if the mage senses an incoming mental or emotional attack, such as an unwanted Mind spell.

After that, the mage can cast the Psychic Projection spell to remain in this state. If he does so, the spell is considered covert, rather than vulgar (since the mage is already out of his body)."

        "descrizione": "<div>While all Seers of the Throne serve the Exarchs and attempt to shape the world to best accommodate both their ambitions and the Exarchs’ desires, the Architects of the Future are especially dedicated to shaping the world to come. The goals of these mages are two-fold. They seek to examine the details of the future and then to prune it like a bonsai. Their goal is to allow only those events to occur that further their particular aims. In addition to shaping the future to meet their needs, the Architects also attempt to quest deep into the Astral Realm, exploring the edges of the Anima Mundi for clues as to the wishes, desires and ultimately the nature of the Exarchs. They then incorporate any insights they gain about the Exarchs into their plan for the future.</div><div>This Legacy is slightly more than 500 years old. It was founded in Florence in the late 15th century, when travelers brought back many previously lost or unknown texts from the Middle and Far East. A few of these seemingly mundane texts were actually long-lost grimoires that the founders of this Legacy used as the inspiration and basis for its attainments. When it first began, the Architects were exclusively focused on learning to shape the future in a precise and exacting fashion so as to advance their founders’ agenda. The Legacy was crafted so as to provide members with both the knowledge and understanding needed to examine the future and discern the actions needed to obtain their desires. The Attainments also provided members with the tools needed to help them accomplish these actions. However, within a few decades some of the senior members of the Legacy began to question the wisdom of shaping the future in such a precise fashion with no regard to the plans of the Exarchs. Several argued that acting purely in the interests of the members might cause their agenda to contradict the wishes of the Exarchs, which could lead to utter disaster if the Exarchs decided to punish them. Also, a few of the more philosophically inclined members believed that the Exarchs have a divine plan for the Fallen World, and that it was the duty of the Architects to attempt to discover these plans.</div><div>Several of the founding Architects believed that the best way to contact the Exarchs was to explore the further reaches of the Astral Realm. To enable them to more effectively accomplish this, they forged a path to the Omphalos of the Anima Mundi that was only open to other Architects. From here, they could explore out to the furthest edges of the Anima Mundi, looking for clues and hints as to the Exarchs’ plans and desires. Definitive answers are effectively impossible when exploring the Astral Realms, and Architects frequently argue about the nature and meaning of any discoveries one of their number makes when exploring the furthest depths of the Anima Mundi. However, they still treat these experiences are worthy of consideration and all Architects take an oath to record all of their journeys into the Astral Realm.</div><div>To attempt to make sense of the Exarchs and to keep track of their various manipulations of the future, the Architects of the Future created several large libraries containing records of every major prophecy and every astral journey their members have made for the last 500 years. These records are as much as source of power for the Architect as their attainments. This information also provides unique insight into both the nature of the Anima Mundi and many details of success and failure when attempting to manipulate the future.</div><div>The Architects are an unusual Legacy in that only the most powerful members gain the knowledge and insight needed to divine the pattern of the future, create the plans needed to change it or to attempt to learn the Exarchs’ desires. Less powerful and experienced members learn how to vastly increase their effectiveness in performing various tasks, but gain no special insights into how best to apply their efforts. Members begin as agents or foot soldiers and work their way to becoming leaders and planners.</div>",

        "appearance": "Most Spiders dress in clothing that is comfortable, utilitarian and that does not inhibit movement. Their clothing also always contains many discrete pockets where they can conceal weapons and other useful items so that they do not attract attention. Because junior members can be sent out to perform some mission at any time, most choose to carry concealed weapons and other useful tools like lock-picks with them at all times. Regardless of their status in this organization, Architects also tend to dress in a relatively high-class fashion. They do this both out of a sense of pride common to members of the Legacy and the recognition that maintaining the appearance of having high social status is an excellent way to minimize Sleeper interference. Most Spiders regularly wear designer suits and athletic gear and other similarly expensive garments. They also possess clothing appropriate for a wide range of settings and activities. Because lower-ranking members often perform dangerous tasks, their jackets, coats and similar garments are often lined with Kevlar or similar materials to provide additional protection against attack.<div>Architects move with confidence and determination. Most appear to be important and charismatic individuals regardless of how they are dressed. They also display a keen awareness of tactical advantage. Intelligence operatives, soldiers trained in commando work, experienced police officers and others who share these traits often notice that the Spider acts like they have had training in combat or covert operations. To Sleepers who lack such training, Architects seem highly competent and possibly somewhat dangerous.</div>",
        "background": "Architects tend to come from physically active backgrounds. Some were soldiers or security personal, others were serious martial arts enthusiasts or athletes and a few were professional criminals. The typical Spider was a physically capable individual who was previously not particularly interested in either philosophy or mysticism. Their Awakening usually came as a great shock and usually occurred during some moment of extreme physical stress. During their Awakening, Spiders suddenly become aware of the larger realities of the Fallen World and most develop a keen interest in pursuing mystical truths.<div>Spiders are highly ambitious and most are comfortable in structured and hierarchical environments. However, for some their ambition was something that grew out of their Awakening, as they suddenly understood how much more power they had than ordinary mortals. Many joined the Legacy as part of their search for answers to the various questions their Awakening raised. New members must be content to accept the answers provided by their superiors, but most are also eager to advance in this Legacy until they too can make plans rather than simply execute them. Spiders possess a mixture of comfort with physical activity, ambition and a relentless desire to both understand and shape the future.</div>",
        "organizzation": "This Legacy is one of the most tightly organized and hierarchical legacies available to the Seers of the Throne. Every member has specified duties that they are regularly called to perform. Members are free to go about their own affairs most of the time, but when one of the senior members sees some situation that requires alteration, they can call upon other nearby members for assistance. All lower-ranking members are required to assist them to the best of their capabilities; while such missions are always presented to members as “requests”, refusing results in a loss of both status and good will, and also a loss of access to the recorded prophecies and other records held by the leaders of this Legacy.<div>Advancing upwards in the Legacy grants members increased power and authority within it. At first, members are only given relatively easy assignments where they almost always work with others and are usually supervised by a more experienced Spider. Upon reaching the second attainment, Spiders start being sent out on important assignments and typically work alone or supervising a few lower-ranking members. The status of members who reach the third attainment changes radically. These Architects enter the Legacy’s inner circle. They come together in secret meetings, where they discuss their shared goals and decide upon the missions that they will send others on. Members at this level only go out on the most important assignments and most often send lower ranking members to act upon their prophecies and visions.</div><div>The lower levels of this Legacy involve a moderate degree of physical danger from the members, and while the senior members never discuss this with their underlings, they keep careful track of any Spider who seems likely to reach the third attainment in the near future. Individuals who the senior members distrust or consider to be inappropriate leaders are discouraged from advancing in this Legacy. Those who refuse to follow these hints are sent on increasingly dangerous assignments. The vast majority of members who the leaders deem to be unsuitable for inclusion in their ranks die before they reach the third attainment of this Legacy.</div>",

The tragedy of those that become Seers is that after Awakening to this truth they choose to side with those wielding the dividing knife as long as they get to be “haves”. Some new recruits to the Ministries, though, believe that they are incapable of attaining the life they wish to lead without aid. No amount of money will make them the person they want to be — beautiful, influential and desired. They feel that even as members of the secret rulers of the world, their rightful place is denied to them. Maybe they’re the wrong height, wrong color, or wrong gender. Maybe they just have no social graces. Eventually, they may hear of a Legacy, first founded in the Hegemonic Ministry, which promises to turn members into members of the Elite. By sacrificing everything that makes them themselves, they can create new identities, like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, and live the lives of luxury and adoration they have watched with envious eyes since their Sleeping days.</div><div>There is a difference between physical alterations that serve a medical need and chasing an unhealthy ideal, and the members of the Chrysalides Legacy are firmly in the chasing category. Every Chrysalis has a dual identity — the nature of the Legacy is such that they can transform from their real self, which they call the “Husk”, into an idealized self created from the imagination and self-loathing of the Seer. Each Chrysalis only has one “Ideal”, one alternate persona, chosen on joining the Legacy. After the initial act of creation, the Ideal can be improved further — granted beauty, cleverness, wit, physical superiority... Anything the Seer believes his real form lacks. But it comes at a price. Every improvement is taken from the real form, which degrades as the Ideal perfects, and there are no take-backs and no second chances. Eventually, a Swan becomes both Beauty and the Beast, the Ideal a living Goddess and the Husk a withered crone. The Legacy sees it as a worthwhile sacrifice, hurrying through the time they spend as the Husk before they are able to transform again. Other Seers shake their heads at the pettiness of the Legacy, muttering that the Awakened should have higher goals. The Swans, surrounded by fawning admirers, don’t agree.</div>",

The desire for power denied was as strong a motivating factor then as it is now, and the original Swans sought the Raptor in dreams, entreating the Seal of Life to release her grip on their bodies and allow them to choose their biological forms.</div><div>It was a Thyrsus named Kunigunde who finally received a vision in reply in the winter of 1530, shortly after the Siege of Vienna by the Turks.

Further improvements require reaching new attainments, and the Swan progresses, chasing some dream of a self nothing like the Husk. But the Raptor’s price is that the  Chrysalides can never truly forget who they were — the transformation is long lasting, but does not last forever. Sooner or later, a Swan reverts to their original body, made as wretched as the Ideal is glorious, and must recuperate before becoming the Ideal again.</div><div>Many Swans become more than a little unhealthy mentally, seeing the Husk and the Ideal as two different people and disassociating with their own identities. The self-loathing that drove them into the Legacy gnaws at them, and the Chrysalides become ever more obsessed with the pleasures they have twisted their real bodies and spent their souls’ potential to acquire.

        "descrizione": "<div>Although many members of the Seers of the Throne specialize in controlling mortals or slaying their enemies, there is as much need to destroy objects as people. A sufficiently powerful relic of Atlantis or a particularly revealing recording of a gathering in a hostel can both be exceptionally damaging to the Seers’ cause. In addition, one of the best and most effective ways to manipulate events is by altering or destroying various objects. If an inventor is about to demonstrate his creation before an audience and the device has either been sabotaged or destroyed and replaced with a version that works either much less well, or perhaps much better, the results of that demonstration will be very different than they otherwise might. Many Seers have also become especially careful to make certain that humanity learns nothing about the supernatural. Destroying all such evidence, from the corpse of a vampire someone killed, to a camera phone containing images of Vulgar Awakened magic being used can be vitally important.</div><div>The Masters of Destruction swore their oaths to serve just this purpose. They are artists of decay and annihilation, understanding how to transform a diamond or a sturdily made safe into dust with a glance or a touch. The greater portion of members are Moros, since almost all Destroyers study both the Death and the Matter Arcana. However, they are less interested in death, ghosts or corpses than they are in objects, especially complex and valuable objects. Some Destroyers become obsessed with the mechanics of precise destruction and will acquire a dozen or more finely made intricate devices just so they can study various ways of destroying or sabotaging them.</div><div>One of the major tensions in this Legacy is between Destroyers who effectively serve as freelance mercenaries who sell their services to any other Seer who will pay their price, and those who regard their Legacy as a spiritual calling and have exceptionally strict and often highly idiosyncratic standards about what they will and won’t tear apart. Since this Legacy is almost exclusively passed down from a single master to a single student, these two branches of the Legacy rarely interact, but when they do, the result is often bitter arguments, and occasionally violence. The most mercenary Destroyers are willing to work for anyone who will pay their price, even Pentacle mages (albeit not without some secrecy and rights of refusal). In vivid contrast, many of the more ideologically inclined Destroyers regard the members of this Legacy as the Exarchs’ sacred agents of entropy and consider any Destroyer who is more considered about payment than ideology or meaning as a traitor to this Legacy’s sacred trust.</div><div>The more ideologically driven Masters of Destruction find destruction to be an almost sacred calling and in addition to advancing their own ends and what they see to be the will of the Exarchs, they occasionally destroy some object simply because they either have imagined a way to make its destruction especially impressive, beautiful or profound. They also sometimes destroy something simply because they decide that it needs to be destroyed for some, often difficult to explain, philosophical reason. Other Seers usually consider Destroyers to either be calculating mercenaries or half-mad fanatics and make certain to distinguish one sort from the other. Most Seers find mercenary Destroyers to be exceptionally useful, but they usually attempt to avoid the more ideologically inclined members of this Legacy because they fear, often not without reason, that one of their treasured possessions might be considered worthy of destruction.</div>",

In fact, most members are actually fascinated by such things. While they do their best not to be too ostentatious, most Destroyers wear and use superbly made clothing and tools and have a preference for fine fabrics, precision metalwork and similar objects. In addition to simply enjoying such accoutrements, Destroyers also typically take great care to maintain their clothing and personal items in ideal condition. It is very rare to see one looking anything other than pristine. A Destroyer with rumpled or worn clothing or using poorly made or badly maintained equipment is either working undercover or in especially dire circumstances.<div>Most Destroyers are relatively quiet people, but they are neither withdrawn nor meek. Instead, they mostly come across as somewhat self-absorbed individuals who feel more comfortable with objects than with people. However, many Destroyers can be quite forceful and bold if faced with a serious challenge to their ideas or ethics.</div>",

Individuals with the skills and temperament for these occupations typically do very well in this Legacy. However, a surprising number of members were museum conservators, people who repaired precision machinery or others who made a career protecting or caring for various sorts of precious objects. During their Awakening, those who were drawn to joining the Seers of the Throne realized that some objects are simply too dangerous to exist. Such people often transfer their focus on protecting precious objects into a determination to rid the world of objects that are inherently dangerous or problematic. Other Destroyers were skilled craftspeople or artists, who now find that their calling has become the artistry of destruction. While their previous careers are highly varied, the one common factor of almost all Destroyers is an interest in, and often an obsession with precision.",

A significant minority are eccentric mystics, but most are freelance saboteurs, who offer their services to other Seers in return for various forms of payment. When a Seer needs something destroyed discretely and effectively, they often call upon a Destroyer and negotiate a price, which can include everything from cash, to information to an Imbued Item or occasionally even an Artifact. <div>Anyone who wishes to become a Destroyer must find a mentor. In return for this tutelage, the student is obligated to perform various favors for their teacher, most often favors involving aiding their master in her missions of destruction. In addition to teaching, the teacher also introduces her student to other Destroyers and informs other nearby Seers of the presence of this new Destroyer. Because the services they provide are fairly specialized and not in high demand, few Destroyers belong to a pylon that contains other members of this Legacy. Most often there is no more than one Destroyer in any city.</div><div>Although most Destroyers keep in touch with their fellows, sharing details of their various missions, these interactions are purely informal, and there are a few recluses who purposefully isolate themselves. Most of the relatively solitary Destroyers are those who see this Legacy as a calling rather than a career. These mages are exceedingly selective when choosing apprentices and usually refuse to socialize with members of this Legacy who hold different views about its meaning and use.</div>",

This attainment allows the Destroyer to easily step in and out of the Underworld, permitting him to take shortcuts through the land of the dead or to vanish at a moment’s notice if he is being observed. In addition, if an object proves too difficult to destroy, the mage can instead pick it up and transport it in the Underworld.

Every year a few hopefuls who see this Legacy solely as a path to both power and safety seek out instruction from one of the members, but very few are accepted.

Members regularly meet to share information and to exchange news of opportunities for their services. However, they do so with little formal hierarchy.

Instead, every member is trained by a mentor who decides whether or not to train them.<div>The majority of members keep their actual identities secret, always appearing as someone else when they meet  their fellows. Most members simply identify themselves by name, regardless of what they may look like, but some also use various visual clues, such as always wearing a particular combination of colors or some other obvious marker, like a unique piece of jewelry. Determining whether or not someone is impersonating another member is difficult. However, the one law among the Imposters is that members must reveal their true Shadow name if they are asked by three or more members of this Legacy at the same gathering. If two members arrive data gathering, both claiming to be the same person, both would almost certainly be asked their true Shadow name by several others in attendance. All statements are checked by both personal questions by other members who know them and by Mind rotes designed to determine the truth or falsehood of their answers. In addition to using meetings of their Legacy as chances to seek status, Imposters also seek out their fellows for more practical purposes.</div><div>Most Princes of the Many Masks use their Legacy in pursuit of their own projects. However, there is often only so much that a single individual can accomplish, and so Imposters regularly meet so they can both brag about their various accomplishments and request aid for their projects. Typically, an Imposter asks for help from one or more of her fellows in return for providing similar help on their projects. Impersonating multiple important individuals in an organization, even if only for a few days, or even a few hours, allows Imposters to bypass almost any series of checks and balances or security protocols that an organization has in place. As a result, several members of this Legacy working together can obtain almost any information or steal almost any easily portable object with little chance of failure or discovery.</div><div>A few Imposters work as freelance contractors who offer their services to Seers who need help infiltrating some organization or impersonating someone else. The availability of Profane Urim and the widespread use of Mind rotes to possess Sleepers means that the demand for such services is relatively small. However, actually impersonating someone offers a degree of precision and immediacy unavailable to mages who must rely on Sleeper puppets and Thralls. When another Seer who lacks the ability to easily impersonate others requires such a service, most contact one of the Princes of the Many Masks, who then either accepts the assignment or passes word about it to other members of this Legacy.</div>",

He watches the Abyss, and in watching it, gives it form and power. She opened a terrible, necessary door to envelop the Fallen World in a spiritual desert: a cloak of madness that bars the Supernal Realms to all but a few powerful, eccentric wills.</div><div>That’s the taboo. Like all taboos, people break it from time to time. Seers disobey, search and usually don’t find anything. Sometimes, they’re caught and punished. A few become Scelesti, and claim to serve the Gate. That’s a lie — they’re only slaves of the Abyss.</div><div>A few succeed. They find the Lonely Exarch. They join a Legacy that’s had many names over the centuries. The Secret Order of the Gate is its latest incarnation, founded over 100 years ago by a pylon that lost three Soldiers to the Pentacle (especially Nameless mages who joined the Free Council) and two more to treachery — rivals who hit them when they were down. That sowed the seeds of doubt, fueled the quest for power beyond the accepted Iron Seals. In 1901, the last three found the Gate in Chicago. Some say they used an Artifact called the Celestial Flange to call her from the Place Between.</div><div>So began the Secret Order and its mission. It is the demiMinistry of the Gate, the Warder, The Fearful Reconciler, King of Zero. They love him. They worship her utterly. That slowly, invariably drives them mad.</div><div>The Secret Order’s inner doctrine speaks of the Serpent and the Tree. The Tree is the Fallen World, growing from filth up to the Supernal Sky. The Celestial Ladder was inevitable; the Tree always climbs, using the smaller life within in to manifest that fecund desire. If it ever grew too tall, it would envelop the heavens in its unclean tendrils and choke existence to death.</div><div>It must be pruned, dismembered and hurt from time to time. The Exarchs did it when they cut down the Celestial Ladder, and the Gate does it still, with the blackest, sharpest blade of all: the Abyss. That’s the anti-reality’s purpose. It’s the Serpent, Niddhog gnawing at the World Tree — but it too must be restrained. The Serpent and the Tree live in symbiosis. Unbeing seeks being, and devours it. Being fills the void until it’s either stopped, or suffocates.</div><div>That’s why the Secret Order of the Gate calls Abyssal horrors into the world, and why it banishes them when they stay too long or eats too deeply into the Tree’s heartwood.</div><div>They let the Serpent prune the world in small pulses of destruction, designed for symbolic import. Killing a city is excessive; killing the man who represents the city is good enough, and the manner of his ending is the rite that controls that symbolic power. So the world is left a smaller place — Fallen, but alive — without raising poisoned branches to the heavens.</div><div>The Secret Order believes in two paths of service: the Opening Way and the Warding Way. Openers summon Abyssal manifestations; Warders banish them. The perfect Gatekeeper performs both duties, but few can maintain the balance. They see too much. Their minds break in one direction or the other and they pick a side. The Gatekeepers call themselves the truest Seers of the Throne, and say the Ministries are foolish for denying it, and leaving the Lonely Exarch in exile.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Parametric Language</h3><div>The Parametric Language is the Gate’s occult tongue. The Secret Order believes the Lonely Exarch used it to command the Abyss to open, and tame the newly-Fallen World — and to banish it, so that the fallen World would survive. It is a language that gives comprehensible structures to the Abyss’ anti-entities. It’s a tongue of negatives, that defines things based on what they are not, providing a general conceptual shape — even a prison — for Abyssal entities.</div><div>All Gatekeepers know the Parametric Language. They can conduct conversations in it, though its grammar makes this a slow, clumsy process. Its chief use is in dealing with the Abyss. Chanting it adds +1 die to spells the specifically target Abyssal entities or manifestations. It sounds like a series of chaotic, guttural syllables and hisses and objectively speaking, it is random noise; it can’t be learned by mages who don’t belong to the Legacy.</div>",

Many Openers think humanity should suffer through a great Abyssal tribulation that ends in a smaller world with a less arrogant population. To the Secret Order, hubris is the Tree’s desire for growth, expressing itself through its human components. Curing it with a lasting, terrible darkness would protect the Supernal Realms. Warders channel their fear of the Abyss into a passion for opposing it, though that doesn’t mean they’ll block the Secret Order’s plans, either.

These visions not only impart knowledge and wisdom, but they give humanity a glimpse into a world not their own. To Sleepers, the phenomenon can be reconciled as messengers from a god. To the Awakened, particularly the Obrimos, these messengers are seen for what they are: agents of the Supernal. The fact that celestial beings could traverse the Abyss and enter the Fallen World has long been a sign of hope to many. To a few it is a call to battle.</div><div>In the late 17th century, an Awakened Jesuit priest known as Alessandro Grimaldi (records are unclear as to whether this was his Shadow Name or his name by birth) saw the influence of the Abyss rise in his native Naples. A member of the Adamantine Arrow, the clergyman fought alongside his order to stem the tide of the growing power. All but the most concentrated strikes did nothing, and many Arrows were lost. As much a scholar as a warrior, Grimaldi turned to books and prayer to find a way to overcome the menace. As his fellow Arrows fought and lost skirmish after skirmish with the creatures of the Void, the Theurgist locked himself in his study, refusing food or water or rest until he could devise a means of victory.</div><div>Forty days and nights past before Grimaldi exited his chambers. When he next appeared on the battlefield, the Jesuit Obrimos called forth a mighty avatar of the Supernal to aid the local Pentacle in their last ditch effort to eradicate now overwhelming Abyssal force. Inspired by the sight of the angelic figure wading through the hostile creatures, the mages redoubled their efforts to drive back the invaders. Grimaldi led the Pentacle mages to victory, his celestial companion powerful enough to combat the brunt of the Void’s assembled might.</div><div>After the battle, Father Alessandro told the assembled that the answer was not found in his books, but in his prayers. Exhausted, and nearly delirious from his quest, he received a vision. The Aetherial being that accompanied him on the field of battle had come to him in his hour of need, offering assistance and support. Over the course of the last week of the monk’s seclusion, Grimaldi and the Supernal being spoke. The angelic form taught him much of the power of the Aether and how to combat the Abyss directly. It helped the Jesuit to shape his soul to enable it, and other instruments of the Oracles like it, to descend to the Fallen World and heed the call to battle.</div><div>In the years the followed, Grimaldi accepted many students; reports of the conflict in Naples spread far and wide, and numerous individuals wished to command the power of Supernal forces. Not all who came to study his ways were altruistic in their intent. The priest quickly determined who was there to oppose the powers of the Abyss and who was there solely for personal gain. Once those interested in power for power’s sake were weeded out, Father Alessandro built his Legacy, which he named the Choir of Hashmallim after the order of angels of the same name, into the foundations of the organization that it is today. The Choir of Hashmallim is focused on disrupting and ending the threat of the Void. Its members hope to inspire others through the use of their Attainments and the glory of the Aether they are able to call upon in battle.</div><div>The war is never-ending, but the Choir persists in the belief that it can be won.</div>",

Of what value, they ask, is virtue untested? It is a simple thing to be good and to do right when no incentive exists to take the easy, wicked, or otherwise morally expedient road. More difficult, by far, is the path of righteousness opposed. The Serpent whispers temptations and strikes at the heels of those who would reach toward grace.

This Mana is, in reality, a metaphysical reflection shining outward from just beyond the outmost edge of the Supernal, being something closer to the idea of Mana than the actual Fallen World substance. As a result, this Mana cannot be stolen from the Adversary, though she can, if she knows the proper magics, transform it into Tass or bestow it upon others in its raw form; whereupon the Daimonic “Mana” ceases to be a conceptual ideal and becomes the ephemeral material familiar to most Awakened. The Concord mage may only benefit from one use of this Attainment per chapter.

The peril to the beneficiary of this Attainment must be real enough that the subject genuinely believes in its capacity to cause her serious harm. Some Adversaries are known to arrange for such circumstances, whether subtly or overtly, simply to demonstrate to their quarry the wages of perseverance.

        "descrizione": "<div>The Katsinam Suukya grew out of the traditions of the Hopi people of the American Southwest. During the United States’ expansion into their territories, more and more traditions and practices disappeared, first through the violence of aggressive expansion and, later, under a tide of cultural assimilation. While some continued to cling to the old ways, keeping them sacred and alive, most were gradually battered down by colonizing frontiersmen and those who followed in their wake. In the late 19th century, a Hopi théarch by the name of Ahota (“Restless One”) set out with the intention of reviving the traditions of his people among Sleepers and Awakened, alike. The first few years of his work, however, proved deeply disheartening, as Ahota ran into one stumbling block after the next.</div><div>To gain a new perspective on his mission, the Shaman embarked on a long journey into Shadow, seeking the advice of the spirits. What he discovered was more and far different than he had hoped, transforming both his mission and his soul. When Ahota returned, he soon gathered five apprentices to himself, only two of whom were of Hopi descent, to pass on what he had learned of the katsinam, the life-bringers; spirit guides who educate the young in the important truths of life. Out of respect for his people’s tradition of obfuscating the deepest nuances of their language from the uninitiated, he simply called his Legacy the Katsinam Suukya, after the title of the life-bringers (already well known outside of the tribe) and the Hopi word for “one,” leaving it to the listener to decide whether Ahota intended them to be “one with the katsinam,” “one of the katsinam,” “one chosen by the katsinam,” or something else, entirely.</div><div>Ahota eventually passed on (though some say he simply vanished into the Shadow once more), leaving a council of elders — several of whom were not Native Americans, let alone Hopi — to govern the Legacy after his death. He claimed that this approach represented a “broader vision” that would “bring peace to the people of the world, through the embrace of traditional ways.” To this day, three of the elders of the council claim to have been apprentices to the first so-called “Caretaker,” but the veracity of such statements is uncertain, at best.</div><div>Regardless, the Katsinam Suukya exists now to bridge a gap between old ways and the pressures of the modern world, admonishing its adherents to return to ancient forms of spirituality for answers to difficult questions. Ahota’s vision, recounted to his first students, told of a time when their ways would be needed to avert some terrible calamity, or to guide many to a better future. A number of those drawn to the Katsinam Suukya feel that its teachings address an emptiness within their lives, so perhaps its practices truly can illuminate a safe road through dark times to come. Today, the Legacy is still a small one, but with a diverse membership that calls upon the influences of the many cultures from which its adherents hail, including several threatened by the march of “progress.”</div>",

Naturally, these Caretakers tend to stand out in a lot of urban areas, but most elders of the Legacy tend to confine their wanderings to more rural and isolated locales. Some stay on reservation land, while others belong to communes, and still others live as hermits. Younger Caretakers, on the other hand, often adopt a more pragmatic aesthetic, though most of them incorporate more traditional elements into their daily dress.<div>Jewelry is often worn, and each piece tells a story. It may be a traditional take that usually accompanies a particular sort of item, or it can be a very specific story about how the object in question was acquired. These tales help to keep alive the great oral traditions that many cultures share.</div>",
        "background": "The Katsinam Suukya is a small Legacy. Its members are not particularly flashy and many modern mages don’t enjoy living a life spent dwelling on old traditions — from a number of different cultures — that they believe no longer serve any useful purpose. Those whose only interest in the past relates to the power that it can offer in the here and now are of little interest to the Caretakers.<div>Occasionally, elders of the Legacy journey far, seeking those souls who are in need of something that they cannot quite grasp. The elder Caretaker then adopts the role of a mentor, if possible, talking of endangered wisdom and old power, and of stewardship over things of genuine importance. Those who seem receptive to these advances are often offered membership. Through this process, the Caretakers maintain and very slowly expand their numbers.</div>",
        "organizzation": "The Legacy is led by a council of elders. The longer one has served the Katsinam Suukya, the more esteem she holds among its membership. Achievements and personal renown often factor into the pecking order amongst the leading elders of the Legacy, but length of service (and the experience that accompanies it) serves as the Katsinam Suukya’s measuring stick when it comes to leadership. While rare, an individual may prove, beyond any reasonable measure of doubt, that she deserves a place on the elder council. The Caretaker must have performed some heroic or otherwise grand service to the Legacy, and are invited to join the elders by popular acclaim.<div>Individual Caretakers are usually left to their own devices. If a senior member of the Legacy requires assistance in a specific task, however, custom dictates that the younger Caretaker comply with the request, unless he has a pressing reason not to. Some elders use the tradition of seniority for their own gain or to purposely inconvenience the young (whether as a lesson or for some other, less benevolent end). This sort of behavior, on the whole, is tolerated within the Katsinam Suukya; if the young mage cannot fulfill his obligation without hardship, then he clearly needed to endure it. As the elders of the Legacy see things, the world is not the nicest of places and to survive, a Caretaker must be as crafty as possible.</div>",

        "descrizione": "<div>The People of the Hour are a product of the fear of the 1950s and the social change of 1960s London. In a world that was yearning for liberty from the timeless certainty of the endless cycle of growing up, getting a job, getting married, having kids, retiring, and dying, a young Acanthus helped inspire others to break free.</div><div>It was 1958. She called herself Lady Peacock, and she was trying desperately to change the status quo of London’s Awakened community. Rigid traditionalists amongst the Silver Ladder and the Mysterium dominated the Consilium. Members of the Adamantine Arrow and the Guardians of the Veil were too preoccupied with their duties to care about a new social agenda in Awakened society. Even Lady Peacock’s fellow Libertines were simply trying to hold onto what little they had, rather than reaching for something better.</div><div>Rather than growing discouraged, however, Lady Peacock determined to evolve through a revolution of thought. She studied the patterns of her native London, following strands of the unfolding future, looking specifically for those near to the Awakening. It was by no means an exact science, but destiny must have had a special place set aside for the young Enchanter, who used her powerful Fate magic to ably perform feats only barely within the limits of the mundane, within plain sight of only those few who were struggling to cast off the Lie. While hidebound elements within the Consilium disapproved of Lady Peacock’s antics, it was actually a théarch — also an Acanthus — who came to her defense, arguing eloquently to all that nothing she did in any way truly threatened the Veil or otherwise compromised the security of local willworkers as a whole. Reluctantly, the Consilium allowed these antics to continue and, as the young mage had hoped, several of these souls Awakened to the Lunargent Thorn.</div><div>What she didn’t expect is that all but one of these new Acanthus eventually went to orders other than the Free Council. The théarch, Ildanach, took the despondent Libertine under his wing, thereafter, counseling her to seek the will of her Path’s native realm in all that she had done and all that followed; for, surely, there was purpose to it. Lady Peacock took Ildanach’s advice to heart in a way that he did not foresee: absconding with a stack of old tomes from the local Lorehouse, the young mage decided to ask Arcadia directly.</div><div>Perhaps it was her magical skill that guided a firsttime summoner through the perilous incantations that brought down one of the mercurial Fae of the Lunargent Thorn to commune with Lady Peacock; likelier, though, it was simply her tremendous good fortune. Ultimately, she got her answer, and a bargain of one sort or another was struck. Lady Peacock became the first of the People of the Hour, those who command the secrets of the future in order to better the present. She began to take on students of all orders — and none — spreading the lore of her new Legacy as widely as possible. Eventually, Lady Peacock left London, altogether, sowing seeds into the cultural whirlwind of the 60s, and reaping their fruits on the return trip.</div><div>The 1970s were a blur of sex, drugs, and experimentation, for Lady Peacock as much as for so many others, and she adopted a wide range of willworkers into the People of the Hour, many of whom had clashing visions of the best of all possible futures. This, as she saw it, was for the best, as each would challenge the others to truly question the rightness of what they did. For the first time, she began to run into the students of her own students, eclectic spirits utterly unknown to her, and Lady Peacock was overjoyed by the ecstatic chaos of it all. The 80s and much of the 90s were, in contrast, a disappointment to the aging Godmother of the People of the Hour, so she did the only thing she could: she fled the known and went seeking the “next big things,” emerging in all sorts of unexpected places and inducting still those who met with her approval into her Legacy. One week, she was undercover in the turbulent Middle East, initiating a well-hidden Libertine Enchanter into the People of the Hour and, the next, she was grudgingly offering tutelage to an Acanthus Guardian who challenged her perceptions of the place of free will in the Fallen World.</div><div>Now in her mid 70s, Lady Peacock (who remains a whimsical, if rarely-seen, friend and mentor to many People of the Hour throughout the world), has yet to slow down and her Legacy follows suit. Forceful and dynamic, the People of the Hour pursue tomorrow with the fervor of those who believe that, if they try hard enough, they can reach out and grab it, and make it into something wondrous. As to the answer to her long-ago question and the bargain that she made to forge her Legacy, however, Lady Peacock says nothing, save to offer a youthful smirk and a playful wink.</div>",

The names of heroes, past and present, are venerated in song, story and even with worship in some societies. The Stygian Heralds go beyond simple adoration to remind others of the capacity heroes have to inspire. They call up the souls of dead heroes, borrowing their strength to serve the living.</div><div>The Stygian Heralds were founded by a Moros who was studying several unusual Artifacts recovered from mystically sealed vault beneath Uchisar, Turkey. The vault itself was an obvious product of magic, the weapons and armor found within had unusual properties that didn’t seem to be the result of enchantment. After months of study, the Moros came to the conclusion that the Artifacts were somehow still bound to their dead owners. The Artifacts seemed to draw energy from a different realm; in them he found the mystical signature of the leaden oppressiveness of Stygia and the echoing eternity of the Underworld. Alongside his continuing studies, the Moros began to experiment with methods of imbuing mundane objects with the same energy and, through trial and error, eventually created the first Attainment of a new Legacy.</div><div>Feeling that he was close to a real breakthrough, the willworkers enlisted the help of several other Moros to assist him in the continuation of his work. He taught them the methods behind his first discovery and the cabal began to call itself the Stygian Heralds: Stygian in honor of their path and Heralds in homage to those humble souls who walked before heroes of lore announcing their coming. Many years passed and when the original founder of the Legacy died, in accordance with his wishes, his name was struck from every record of the Legacy, ensuring that he would be forgotten and allowing him to abide in peace. Stories persist, though, inside the Legacy and without, about whom the founder really was.</div><div>A few mages, prompted by jealousy (or so the Heralds believe), declared that the founder must have been a Tremere. They suggest that only someone with in-depth knowledge of how to trap and manipulate a soul could have developed magical means of compelling the shades of the dead, of ripping them from wherever it is they rest. The Stygian Heralds refuted the idea, pointing to the fact that the founder died of natural causes: an unlikely event for a Tremere. Another group of mages posit that the first of the Heralds was a descendant of the Orphean tradition, citing the mythological character as one of the few mages to ever descend to the Underworld and return intact. The Heralds openly scoff at this theory, rightly pointing out that no one is sure exactly from whence the practices of the Legacy call the dead souls. It’s just as likely the shades are drawn from the Supernal, or even the Astral Realms, as from the Underworld.</div><div>Questions of founder aside, the Stygian Heralds slowly spread their wisdom throughout Awakened society and not everyone approved of their methods. It was a member of the Adamantine Arrow who dubbed them “Resurrectionists,” likening their practices to those of grave robbers. Rather than being insulted by the nickname, the Heralds embraced it, noting that the actions of the resurrectionists helped further the science of medicine with their grim deeds. The side-effects resultant from the Stygian Herald’s blessings didn’t go unnoticed either. Individuals that repeatedly served as host to the souls of heroes had a tendency to go insane.

The eye is of alien appearance (not merely a red iris, for instance, but instead perhaps a sickly yellow-green throughout, with a vaguely barbell-shaped pupil, and perpetually cracked and scabbing skin on the eyelid). While the eye is uncovered, the mage can always see Abyssal powers and phenomena and know them for what they are (including any Paradox effect, even Backlash damage) within visual range.</div><div><b>Hand:</b> Traditionally, the right hand is replaced by members of the Legion, leaving the left intact. The hand may appear unnaturally bloated or gangrenous, or otherwise grotesque. With a successful touch (an instant action requiring skin-to-skin contact and a normal Strength + Brawl roll against an unwilling subject), the mage may spend a point of Mana to afflict a target with a poison the toxicity of which is equal to one-half the Legion willworker’s Gnosis, rounding down (see The World of Darkness, pp. 180–1 for rules on toxins). Note that the poison inflicts lethal damage and may be freely applied to a grappled or incapacitated individual, or one who otherwise allows the mage to touch her with the replacement hand.</div><div><b>Tongue:</b> The mage’s replacement tongue (which may look, for example, like an oversized slug or be split like a reptile’s) enables her to incite madness through speech. With an instant action and a successful Manipulation + Gnosis roll, contested by the subject’s Composure + Gnosis, the Legion mage may inflict a derangement of her choosing on an individual, which lasts until the subject next regains one or more points of Willpower.</div>",

This anomaly has a radius of 10 yards per dot of Gnosis and lasts for one hour per point of Gnosis. Also, the Legion mage need no longer breathe (and so cannot be asphyxiated or choked unconscious, for instance). The willworker’s chest may appear rotted or unnaturally shriveled, or her lips and throat may manifest bleeding, infected sores. (Note that this counts as a zero-success Paradox effect for the purposes of the heart transformation, below.)</div><div><b>Skin:</b> The mage’s entire skin is peeled away and replaced (potentially appearing corpselike, riddled with extensive rashes and infections, or even translucent and gelatinous) with a membrane possessed of chameleonic qualities. When nude or mostly nude and attempting to blend into her environment, the Legion willworker receives a bonus to her Stealth roll equal to her Gnosis.</div><div><b>Stomach:</b> By replacing his stomach (which may cause the abdomen to swell abnormally or the skin over it to slough away, revealing a layer of greasy fat over raw muscle), the willworker gains the ability to forcibly vomit a potent acid. This requires a point of Mana and a Dexterity + Athletics + Life roll (penalized by the target’s Defense and ignoring any non-magical armor). Each success inflicts a point of resistant lethal damage.

He is permanently cured of any and all derangements (including those gained through Wisdom degeneration) and can never again gain a derangement, through whatever means, even temporarily. To be clear, the mage is not sane; rather, he is wholly at peace with the otherworldly madness within him. Further, his thoughts, emotions, and perceptions are those of the Gulmoth that thinks for him, and he may, once per turn, spend a point of Mana reflexively to re-roll after failing to overcome a Mind Arcanum spell (or other mind-affecting power) targeted at him. As a result of this change, the skin on the willworker’s head may, for example, rot away in places, revealing muscle and bone or his cranium might swell grotesquely, splitting the skin or his scalp with stress and pressure.</div><div><b>Heart:</b> The seat of the mage’s very life is replaced by an Abyssal entity, allowing him to consume Paradox and transform it into Mana. Whenever any Paradox roll within sensory range of the Legion willworker accrues one or more successes, he may reflexively roll Stamina + Gnosis to attempt to devour those Paradox successes on a one-for-one basis, which the Acamoth within him converts into Mana (up to the maximum allowed by his Gnosis; excess Mana bleeds off without effect) that cannot be taken from him, given by him to another, converted into Tass, or in any way separated from him, save through usage. Any Paradox successes in excess of the mage’s, however, inflict points of resistant lethal damage upon him, on a one-for-one basis, and have no further effect. The mage’s blood may turn to a thin, watery pus (making him look hideously jaundiced), become a viscous purple-black tar (afflicting him with what appear to be huge bruises and internal hemorrhages all over his body), or otherwise take on unnatural characteristics reflected in his outward appearance.</div><div><b>Spine:</b> In a mockery of the ladder that once reached the heavens, the Legion mage permits an Abyssal spirit to consume and replace her spinal column. Irregular spurs of bone may jut from her vertebrae, like quills through the skin, or her posture become hunched in a feral, animalistic pose, while weeping sores follow the trail of her spine, from the base of the skull to the small of her back. Whenever another mage generates Paradox in the Legion willworker’s sensory range, she may compel a Manifestation, which is under her direct control.

It trembled, in its inhuman, fleshless way, when the deathly fear seeped in through the breach and its immaterial substance recoiled, as though beset with illness. It was frightened and uncertain, alone and unique, without any sense of what had transpired or how it might survive this terrible affliction. Like all living things, it wanted to continue to exist, but had no notion of how to do so. It grew sick and deranged as the infection of otherness spread, just as a biological system succumbs to infection and dementia. It had always been and was faced with the very real prospect that such would not continue to be so.</div><div>Then, a new healthy place scraped along the edge of the ragged wound in its reality; so tempting, with its fertile space, free of the pestilence. Terrified at the prospect of ceasing to be, it unhesitatingly migrated to the new universe, slithering into the alien landscape and, slowly, beginning the long process of recovery. As it healed, however, it began to strain against the boundaries of the much smaller place into which it had entered. Worse still, when it cast its perceptions about in an effort to locate its old home, it could find no trace. The conjunction between its old reality and this new one was, it seems, fleeting, leaving it stranded in a space in which it would, inevitably, smother and perish for want of anyplace into which to grow and flourish.</div><div>Just as it believed it would die, stifled and constricted in this cell, another such place touched the walls of its new reality, and it extruded a portion of its substance into that similar space, remaining fundamentally connected to itself through the overwhelming similarities between the two distinct universes. Provided that it could continue to spread from place to place in such a manner, it could recover fully and, perhaps, even become greater and more expansive than it had been in its original place.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Secrets</h3><div>The greatest secret of the Morphean Continuity is that it isn’t truly a Legacy. While the obvious connection — that it is, in fact, an invading consciousness, gradually usurping the minds, bodies and spirits of willworkers — is certainly of interest, perhaps more significant is the fact that this simple truth provides hope for those infected by its presence. While the mage’s soul is shaped by contact with the being in a manner cosmetically identical to that witnessed in a mage who adopts a normal Legacy, process is, theoretically, reversible.</div><div>The Dreamtime entity that constitutes the ephemeral component of Endymion’s Legacy can be repelled through the use of undesirable stimuli. The being greatly fears feelings of loss, isolation, alienation, and confusion, as well as being confronted with a sense of mortality. These sensations may be created through mundane means, though Mind Arcanum magic is probably a more effective vector. When successfully and persistently attacked in this way, the “cell” within an individual attempts to retreat into the Oneiros of its host, relinquishing control of her conscious mind (and cutting her off from all of her Attainments). In order to completely drive out the infection, however, the assault must continue relentlessly, pushing the “cell” out of the host’s Oneiros and into the Temenos. From there, severed from the remainder of its substance (in the form of the other hosts within the physical plane), it instinctively attempts to reach the Dreamtime, though it may or may not survive the journey.</div><div>Note that an infected character is virtually incapable of initiating the process of driving the entity out on his own (since being “afflicted” with a self-aware Legacy is virtually inconceivable, in general, and particularly to a host of the organism), but can participate in the offensive once it has gained some purchase within his mind and spirit.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Rumors</h3><div>Because of the fundamental disconnect between the Dreamtime entity and human consciousness, Endymion and his students gradually become alien in outlook, their altered mentality ever increasingly apparent to outside observers. Because they are all extensions of a single organism, their behaviors evince an eerie similarity. From there, it’s certainly not difficult to assume that Endymion has somehow duped all of his disciples into adopting a Legacy that gradually transforms them into instruments of his will. While this is true, from a certain point of view, it’s not a accurate assumption.</div><div>It’s certainly possible to follow the trail of the Dreamtime creature from its point of origin back to Endymion and his students, rather than the other way around. In fact, with the clever use of even the most elementary of magic, it may well be within the cabal’s power to piece the puzzle together in given sequence. Willworkers are often particularly suited to unraveling even the most obscure mysteries in relatively short order, once they actually realize they’re on the trail of some shred of esoteric lore. Characters interested in astral journeys, Mind Arcanum magic, psychic phenomena and similar subjects may well be up to the challenge of discerning what’s really going on, here.</div><div>Maybe the characters aren’t mages and the Morphean Continuity is, to them, just some sort of bizarre religion or commune on the outskirts of town. Perhaps they are supernatural beings and perhaps not, but the hosts of the Dreamtime entity are certain not to fit in among normal people. As their numbers slowly grow and individual members become more and more a part of a single, segmented consciousness, they attract more attention. Perhaps other mages have to take steps to silence the Legacy and the characters, as outsiders, are drawn into the struggle. Then again, maybe the characters resolve to do something about this group on their own initiative.</div>",

These feelings invariably pass after a second or two, but they can be disturbing.</div>",

Now, she permanently benefits from an effect almost identical to the Mind 3 spell, “Sleep of the Just” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 212), with a few notable alterations. First, the mage need no longer sleep, at all, if she doesn’t wish to. The autonomic portions of her brain realign her body’s energy consumption, so as to allow for perpetual wakefulness without deleterious physical consequences. In order to function, however, the mind dream, so the mage cannot go more than 24 hours without allowing a dream state to take over, . These “waking dreams” are hazy and incorporate fantastic elements into the mage’s more mundane perceptions of the world around her. Consider these to be equivalent to a hallucinogen (see the World of Darkness Rulebook, p. 177: –2 to all dice pools, as well as Defense, for four hours after the first 24 continually awake, and then for four hours out of every 24, thereafter, until the mage actually gets at least four hours of sleep). “Seeing through” these hallucinations requires a Wits + Composure roll, at the –2 penalty, but the willworker cannot truly make them go away without actually getting some rest. Mind Arcanum perceptions and similar senses reveal nothing unusual in these hallucinations (which, in and of itself, might set off warning bells). The Dreamtime entity has partially reconstructed its native environment within the mind and soul of the mage.</div><div><b>Side Effects:</b> At this point, the mage begins to feel a persistent, though surmountable, urge to impart the secrets of the Legacy upon another appropriate willworker, as the organism within her strains at the boundaries of the consciousness that it is slowly filling. Also, the “alien feelings” become increasingly frequent and intense, though they are still quite brief. Some of these thoughts and sensations are now likely quite terrifying (“How would it taste and feel if I were to eat that box of nails?” or “My eyes seem inefficient. I should scoop them out and make better ones.”) The willworker won’t hurt herself or others on account of these strange thoughts and desires, though she is apt to develop derangements on account of her detachment from reality, which may cause her to unwittingly harm herself or someone else. She may get the sense that she is “not alone” inside her own head, though Endymion and/or the handful of other elders of the Legacy are quick to reassure her that this is a natural stage in her spiritual transformation, as her mind expands to encompass new vistas.</div>",

To do so, the player spends a point of Mana and rolls Presence + Empathy + Time. Success “rewinds” a single turn, as per the description of that spell. Note, however, that a Dreamcrafter can only use this Attainment to “replay” a given turn , no matter how many points of Mana he has (though nothing stops the mage from casting the spell itself if the Attainment doesn’t give him the result he wants). Effectively, the original action spirals off into a dream of a future that will never be, while the actions taken during the “rewound” turn are — and always have been — the course of events.",

The player rolls Manipulation + Empathy + Mind, contested by Resolve + Gnosis. This effect targets any or all of the subject’s five mundane senses. Any attempt to penetrate even an implausible hallucination with a Resolve + Composure roll is penalized by the hybrid’s dots in Mind.</div><div><b>Side Effects:</b> At this point, the dreamlike haze suffered during periods of fatigue grows to encompass every moment of the hybrid’s existence, though it is better at processing this information and merely suffers a –2 penalty to all actions, other than casting spells and using Attainments. The being never sleeps, though it must still continue to fuel and care for its body in every other way (initially, shortly after achieving symbiosis, it will likely forget needs such as food, water, and healing, but it gets better at programming these unfamiliar necessities into a given host’s routine as time goes on). At every opportunity, the hybrid imparts the secrets of this Legacy to any Acanthus and/or libertine willing to learn them. Also, the Dreamcrafter no longer takes actions — even on account of insanity or ignorance — which endanger its corporeal form. This is its home, now, after all.</div><div>If a player’s character has progressed to this point without somehow excising the Dreamtime entity from his consciousness, he becomes a Storyteller character, no longer truly human. While others be able to cut out the invading intelligence, the character can no longer help himself, as loses himself to psychic and spiritual symbiosis. As stated above, concepts uncomfortable to the entity (like isolation or the realization of its own mortality) can be used to drive it out, though another mage might also be able to exile it by calling upon a spirit with the appropriate Influences or Numina, or possibly even with some unusual variant of the exorcism ritual used to banish ghosts (see the World of Darkness Rulebook, p. 214).</div>",

It prevented mages from using their skills to humanity’s greatest benefit.</div><div>In the aftermath of the Second World War, three mages realized, grudgingly, that Quiescence might have another, beneficial function. It kept mages separate from Sleepers so that Sleepers could manage the world in their own way. Maybe the Abyss was there for a reason?</div><div>These three mages were all comrades in arms, having served in France. One of them, Ellis Weaver, was wounded in battle and returned home before the end of the war. Another, George West, was promoted and rode out the war in command bunkers, rather than in the field. The last, Hans “Johnny” Dorfmann, stayed in the field and was present when US forces liberated the Dachau concentration camp in 1945.</div><div>When they reunited after the war, they drank and talked and laughed, and finally, after several bottles of bourbon, someone said what they were thinking: Humanity was leaving magic behind. Magic was powerful and amazing, but it was slow, and everything that the three of them could see pointed to the future being all about speed, efficiency and mass production. They could work within that system, they felt, or they could live forever outside of it.</div><div>That night saw the beginnings of the Quiescent, a Legacy devoted not to the destruction of magic or its removal from the world, but to the practice of magic that would work within the Fallen World. Their magic would be invisible, explainable as coincidence, guiding rather than forcing. Yes, it would be challenging, and yes, they would be leaving behind some of their most impressive abilities. But they would also be safer. As paranoia grew in the wake of the brewing Cold War, the three of them were even more convinced that they were right.</div><div>Over the next few years, the three of them trained other mages in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Detroit in their philosophy. They inducted a few into the Legacy, once they were sure that the subject was ready to leave behind the quick power and flashy results that vulgar magic brought. Their philosophy and magical style, known as Quiet magic, proved more popular (and, obviously, easier to adopt than the Legacy), and other mages began spreading it. Entire Quiet cabals, known as “Whispering” or “Sotto Voce” cabals, arose, but the Consilii to which they belong rarely had a sense of who they were or what they were doing. As such, they gained a reputation as being untrustworthy, maybe even Seer plants. This, in turn, drove the Quiet mages even further from the mainstream of mage society.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Schism</h3><div>In 1948, Hans Dorfmann split from the cabal. In his letter to his friends, he claimed that it wasn’t working. It wasn’t enough to work magic invisibly. Magic needed to stop. With horror, George and Ellis realized that Hans had become a Banisher. Within three weeks, more than 20 Quiet mages across the country were dead. Hans couldn’t possibly have killed them all, or so his former cabal-mates thought — not unless he was using his mastery of Space magic to transport himself around.</div><div>Ellis and George contacted as many of their followers as they could, but part of the Quiet philosophy was a focus on avoiding easy detection. As such, by the time they could make contact with many potential targets, they were already dead. Wracked with guilt, the two of them stepped back from Awakened society in 1950.</div><div>Many practitioners of the Quiet philosophy, though, never having actually met the three founders, were perfectly safe (at least from Hans). They went about their lives in the bleak years of the late 1940s, attempting to live in harmony with the direction that the Sleepers seemed to be taking the world.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Quiet Philosophy</h3><div>As mentioned in the text above, the most important principle of the Quiet philosophy is that the mage use no vulgar magic. Every spell the mage casts must be in keeping with the natural laws of the Fallen World. That means that the mage should have some grounding in physics and probably other scientific fields as well, and Quiet mentors often counsel their pupils not to rely on the propensity of Sleepers to shrug off weird occurrence. Yes, Sleeper witnesses might say, “it could happen,” but magic does not occur in a vacuum. The Abyss is always watching.</div><div>Beyond that, however, the Quiet philosophy doesn’t ask much. Mages aren’t expected to follow precepts of non-violence, beneficence or honesty. The founders did endorse living in the Fallen World and not pretending it was something other than it was. Mages have the same choices and opportunities as Sleepers, and sometimes that means taking the dirty money or pulling the trigger.</div><div>As might be expected, some mages take the wrong lessons from Quiet. It’s easy to hear “do what you have to do” and see that as “do anything you want.” This is one reason that Quiet mages have bad reputations in many Consilii. Fortunately, another important precept of Quiet is keeping one’s head down and staying out of sight of the authorities, both Sleeper and Awakened.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Quiet Magic in the Modern Age</h3><div>What happened to the Quiet mages and the Quiescence Legacy? Hans never came for George or Ellis, but the two of them vanished from Awakened society entirely. Their first pupils formed a cabal which remained active into the 1950s (and is detailed in the Appendix to this book), but their whereabouts after that point are unknown. It is probable that, as the paranoia of the 1940s and 1950s gave way to the radicalism of the 1960s, the philosophy simply became outmoded and unpopular. The Legacy, of course, was harder to shed, and so it is likely that a few Liars still live today.</div>",

Centuries of striving to prepare humanity for escape have had no appreciable effect, however, with successful Ascensions remaining the stuff of frustrating rumor and legend. The enemy guards the Supernal Realms too well.</div><div>The Cwn Annwn (“Hounds of Annwn”, pronounced “Coon Ann-Win”) are a recently founded théarch Legacy from Wales, now spreading through the Consilii of the UK and Western Europe. Legacy members arrive in Silver Ladder caucuses, making grandiose claims of having escaped the Fallen World and living in an otherworldly paradise beyond the Exarch’s grasp. They return to the Fallen now to recruit new Obrimos to the Legacy and get the word out. Curious candidates for membership are taken to the Gardeners’ new world. Those who want in stay there for training while the mentor moves on.</div><div>After the Gardener leaves, the Consilium notices odd phenomena. Items have gone missing. Hallows have been drained. People have vanished, without a trace. Wide areas of the Consilium’s territory have been despoiled by some supernatural force, crumbling every living thing to dust in crop-circle like patterns. No witnesses saw anything, but a few report hearing something – a terrible howl in the distance, like a hound.</div><div>The Gwynedd Consilium in Northern Wales is sparsely populated but has a historical reputation for producing innovative mages. The isle of Anglesey is the origin of many druidic Legacies, and the Consilium still claims to have been founded by the Acanthus Archmage now remembered as Merlin. In 2005, a théarch Obrimos named Argent arrived in the Consilium, claiming to have retired from work as a Lictor abroad. His Cabal had been killed by Seers, he claimed, while chasing rumors of an Ascended mage in the hopes of following her footsteps.</div><div>In fact, Argent had fled his Cabal after coming to the conclusion that Ascension was not possible and being rather too open with his opinion. He proposed that if the Supernal Realm was barred, the Silver Ladder should seek to move humanity to another world away from Fallen reality, somewhere mages could assume the godhood the order promised. Denounced as a heretic, he stole grimoires describing pacts with beings from outside Fallen reality and fled before his theft could be uncovered. His Consilium declared him Left-Handed in his absence, but he had no intention of ever going back.</div><div>Argent didn’t come to Gwynedd by chance. The region is rife with verges and sealed gateways to other realms, perhaps the aftereffect of the long-vanished archmaster’s studies. He needed a Hallow in a remote area where the walls of the physical world grew thin in order to complete the ritual he’d uncovered. The blasphemous texts spoke of an in-between place, a void which was not the Abyss but could be filled by the energies of the Fallen World if an explorer was talented enough at giving form to Mana.</div><div>Argent conducted his ritual with the blood of a sacrifice boiled in the center of his Hallow, tainting the Mana there. When he absorbed the Mana into his pattern, he felt something inside his soul open, and found himself elsewhere, floating in nothingness but surrounded by Mana.</div><div>Discovering that he could create Phantasms using the energies around him, Argent shaped a crude world for himself before the effect wore off and he returned to his body in the Fallen World. He was greeted by devastation — the integrity of solid objects around the Hallow had been siphoned by the forces unleashed, the Mana he’d been fashioning stolen from everything around him.</div><div>And something had come back from his new world — which he now knew to be in the Lower Depths. Something tied to his pattern. Something that hungered.</div><div>Seven years later, Argent — now calling himself Arawn — has recruited a Legacy of followers. By tainting the resonance of Mana they absorb, membersoftheLegacycanproject themselves into the pocket-world, which is now a sprawling paradise garden filled with earthly delights, beautiful art and even human life. In Annwn — named for the paradise of Welsh myth – they are free from Paradox and the threats of the Fallen World. They have achieved the promise of the Silver Ladder, but it does not come without cost.</div><div>Annwn is built out of Phantasms and ephemera, although the Legacy hopes to recruit enough Masters to create true patterns one day. It is inherently unstable and requires vast amounts of Mana to avoid breaking up and being absorbed by the rest of the Lower Depths. The void it was built in is also far from being uninhabited. Every member of the Legacy is host to a being of the Lower Depths, an invisible force that lacks any of the Arcana and so is extremely difficult to perceive with magic. These “hounds” are invisible and intangible, having no Life, Matter, or Forces Patterns to be interacted with, and serve as roving feeding appendages for Annwn itself. The hounds siphon integrity from the Fallen world and feast on raw Mana when they can, funneling the energies into the Lower Depths where they support the Legacy’s dreamworld.</div><div>The Cwn Annwn have found that, with effort, they can force their hound to rebuild a facsimile of what they destroy within Annwn, which gives them some measure of control over what is sacrificed to power their realm. Their paradise is built from these stolen patterns — when a Gardener finds something worthy of inclusion in Annwn, he directs his hound to reduce it to Mana and the image of it appears within the realm. Arawn cautioned his followers to only use this when it would not be noticed, but some members of the Legacy have taken the practice to extremes — and worse, begun using the ability on living beings. The “human” inhabitants of paradise are the reconstructed images of Sleepers and mages the Cwn Annwn thought worthy of inclusion, broken puppets with the faces of people the hound felt met his criteria.</div><div>Arawn wants the Legacy to develop Arcana until they don’t need to steal any more — he hopes that once he is able to create Hallows for Annwn to feed from, the realm will become self-sufficient. He wants to entice a Master of Life and Mind into the Legacy, as they will then be able to create real (albeit soulless) people inside. For now, though, he is increasingly alone in his quest as the Legacy succumbs to impatience. Led by a student named Hafgan, the Cwn Annwn have begun travelling across Consilii, taking whatever they want and recruiting more mages to the Legacy. With exposure to magical society, the risk increases that someone will work out what the Cwn Annwn are doing and hold them to account for it. Until then, they’ll continue moving from city to city, telling tales of their unearthly paradise beyond the Exarch’s sight.</div>",

The mage must allow Mana to build up in the Hallow until it is full, then dramatically alter the resonance by either defiling it with destroyed purity (most Hellhounds use the blood of humans or traditionally “pure” animals such as white lambs) or successfully casting the Prime ••• spell “Disguise Resonance” with a –3 dice penalty. When the mage absorbs all Mana from the Hallow, he is able to undergo a meditative journey to project himself into Annwn. The journey requires 10 successes on an extended meditation roll and consumes all the Mana absorbed from the Hallow if successful. The mage’s body is left behind, helpless, as with an Astral journey. Most Cwn Annwn use Life magic to extend the time they can safely stay in Annwn without eating or drinking.</div><div>Upon returning to the Fallen World for the first time, the Gardener is linked to a Hound of Annwn, a being of the Lower Depths that now serves as a familiar.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Hound of Annwn</h3><div>A Hound of Annwn is not a spirit or a demon.

Souls can’t be duplicated—moving a soul deletes it from its original location—making it the ultimate proprietary software. Legacy mages explore souls through their cognitive functions, making them specialize in the Mind Arcanum.</div><div>The first User, Carbon, utilized soul stones as a quick and dirty “proven technology” to enable higher attainments. He promised to find a more secure substitute but never came through. Thus, Cloud Infinite’s mages routinely, yet reluctantly create them. Fortunately, their attainments work with any soul stone that meets the symbolic requirement (it must be an information storage device) so members may con naïve or desperate sorcerers into making them—a stupid, stupid move, but Awakened history has its fair share of them.</div>",
        "firstAttainmentName": "Exploit Spare Cycles",
        "firstAttainmentPrerequisites": "Gnosis 3, Mind 2 (primary)",
        "firstAttainmentDescription": "<div>The User can command a Sleeper to literally do his thinking for him. For the mage, this resembles the spell “Multi-Tasking,” in that the target performs two mental extended actions or one mental instant action and telepathically relays the conclusions back to the User. The target uses any relevant information the mage provides through subconscious telepathy, but the Storyteller rolls his Mental dice pools, not the User’s. This leaves the User free to take any other action. As this is an attainment, not a spell, the User may cast spells while the target works. Roll Intelligence + Academics + Mind the target’s Composure. The attainment’s duration is Prolonged (one scene) or lasts until all tasks have been completed, whichever comes first. The User need not concentrate on the target, but must remain in line of sight, and cannot use the attainment on more than one person at a time.</div><div>The target of Exploit Spare Cycles is unaware that he’s thinking for the User, who uses mental power that would usually be devoted to subconscious impulses. Unfortunately, this denies the victim access to his Vice for the duration of the attainment—he gains no satisfaction from his passions. The victim might dream of the problem he solved, or a psychic (including a user of the Mind Arcanum) might be able to uncover it at a later date.</div><div>This attainment does not function on mages, other supernatural beings, or nonhumans. If the User possesses a soul via the Thought Administration attainment, he may exercise this attainment upon that soul as well.</div>",
        "firstAttainmentOptArcana": "Prime 2",
        "firstAttainmentOptDescrizione": "<div>With Prime 2, the User doesn’t need to remain in the target’s line of sight. Instead, the target’s conclusions magically record themselves on any information storage medium the mage activates with 1 point of Mana. The device must remain in the same room or general area as the thinker, but the mage can go about his business.</div><div>The results of the thinker’s actions manifest as appropriate to the medium, from written pages to multimedia files on a hard drive, but can only be perceived by the User. This magical data doesn’t truly take up space on the chosen device and lasts for 24 hours before it fades into the object’s general Resonance. Members of Cloud Infinite often enchant a target’s office computer and remotely access the information they desire from its hard drive.</div>",

        "secondAttainmentDescription": "<div>The User steals a Sleeper’s soul by claiming its intellectual capacity. An extended action is required using Intelligence + Persuasion + Mind, contested the victim’s Resolve. If the mage succeeds, she now possesses the victim’s soul. The victim suffers soul loss (see p. 276 of the Mage core rulebook) and the User may utilize the soul’s Mental Attributes and Skills as a secondary actor for mental tasks that would benefit from teamwork (see “Teamwork” in the World of Darkness core rulebook, p. 134). This costs 1 point of Mana per dice roll for the secondary actor.</div><div>Over time, the stolen soul’s intellect erodes, losing one dot in a single Mental Attribute per week. This cycles through each Mental Attribute until one score drops to 0. At that point, the soul is no longer fit for use and must be discarded. If the victim is still alive, he suffers the Attribute loss as well. In addition, soul intelligences acquire derangements as their Morality degrades at the rate of 1 point per week.</div><div>Like Exploit Spare Cycles, this attainment does not affect mages, supernatural beings, or nonhumans. The mage may only use one soul at a time.</div>",
        "secondAttainmentOptArcana": "Prime 3",
        "secondAttainmentOptDescrizione": "If the mage possesses Prime 3, he may store souls in any soul stone that takes the form of an information storage device. After stealing a soul, he transfers it by touching the stone, concentrating (an instant action), and spending 1 point of Mana. To absorb the soul and make use of it, he performs this process again. The User may store a number of souls within each soul stone equal to the lower of his Mind or Prime. Within a soul stone, souls do not lose mental capacity, so the mage may “swap out” souls to extend their lifespans or select a soul with desired capabilities to assist him with a task. Souls continue to lose Morality dots at the rate of 1 per week, however.",

        "thirdAttainmentDescription": "<div>After concentrating (an instant action), the User may now emulate the effects of “Supreme Augmentation” (Mage core cook, p. 216) with regard to Mental Attributes only. Unfortunately, additional dots must be harvested from souls in his possession. These may be souls accumulated using “Thought Administration” or acquired from a soul jar in his possession. Subtract up to as many dots as the mage’s Mind score from one or more souls’ Mental Attributes and add them to the mage’s dots in corresponding Attributes. The effects last for a scene, after which the mage’s Mental Attributes return to normal, but those of his victims do not.</div><div>As Soul Processing is not a spell, it can be stacked with “Augment the Mind” and similar Attribute enhancement magic. In these cases, the spell’s duration drops to Transitory even if would normally last longer.</div>",
        "thirdAttainmentOptArcana": "Prime 4",
        "thirdAttainmentOptDescrizione": "With Prime 4, the mage may now remotely access souls in his possession for the purpose of any attainment from her Legacy, provided they’re connected via ley line (as per the Prime 3 spell, “Ley Lines”). She may access a maximum number of souls at any given time equal to the lower of her Mind and Prime dots. This allows her to access multiple soul stones and soul jars (one per turn) that might not be physically present. Users often cast “Mobile Node,” (see below) to ease the use of this attainment."

To some Guardians, the Masques are real, alternate selves, so the crimes they commit while playing a part are not their sins. They belong to the Masque, to be shed as easily as a cloak or wig.</div><div>It’s a comforting lie. No matter the Masque, a single soul can only bear so much—but other souls might bear the burdens of spies and assassins. A loyal operative avoids moral culpability by shunting his guilt to stolen souls. They do terrible, necessary things; she takes refuge in a greater purpose. She protects the sanctity of magic and sacrifices her ego for the order. She becomes the Guardian ethos, manifest in many faces, and finds peace in that purity. She becomes the unspoken, hidden hand: (Legion). She cannot sin because she isn’t a person.</div><div>This is also a lie—the self deception that drives mages into the Legacy’s embrace. For some, this isn’t even a conscious process. During a traumatic mission, a vulnerable Guardian slips into a fugue state. She returns to sanity to find the job done and a stolen soul whispering in her mind.</div><div>Guardians of the Veil initially deny that (Legion) exists but when pressed call it a schismatic sect: a Mastigos faction obsessed with the Masques. But (Legion) is nothing so organized. It merges an urge to escape accountability with the order’s peculiar understanding of the psyche. (Legion) mages try to use stolen souls as moral proxies. It doesn’t work (their Wisdom fluctuates as usual) but provides the illusion that someone else always commits their wrongdoings. Given enough time, members abandon their names, personal tastes and other marks of individuality. They pretend to be at peace and blame their emotions on stolen selves.</div><div>(Legion) possesses no set structure or even a real name. (“Legion” is written in brackets because the half that knows it belongs to a Legacy doesn’t call it anything in particular.) The “Legion schism” is an outsiders’ term.

A cell’s mages may be selfless, but their shared personas form cliques and instigate arguments, screaming and striking from whatever body they happen to inhabit.</div>",

She grasps her target, triggering an extended action. Roll her Manipulation + Subterfuge + Death, resisted by rolling the target’s Resolve. Before seizing the Sleeper’s soul, the (Legion) member must concentrate on a specific objective: “Kill John Maverick,” or “Open the closet door by the front stairs at Cormant House.” The effects of True Masque end when the mage either achieves this objective or 24 hours pass, whichever comes first.</div><div>Once the mage seizes the Sleeper’s soul, he adopts its owner’s aura and surface thoughts. However, he loses the ability to cast spells. From nimbus to Resonance, the spiritual signs of Awakening vanish. (Legion) mages often imbue their bodies with spells for the tasks ahead of them (in which case, their Resonance can be discerned by mages and certain other supernatural beings) to compensate for relative powerlessness while they use the True Masque.</div><div>The mage’s true mind retreats to her subconscious, where it remains dimly aware of the situation and distracts his stolen, conscious self enough to ignore inconsistencies such as a new body or the traumatized “duplicate” he recently saw. If he looks different from his usual self, he takes steps to correct his appearance, up to the point of simple disguises he can justify as compensating for “looking sick.” Under the attainment’s influence, the (Legion) member’s Physical Skills do not change, but her Mental and Social Skills drop to the worse of the mage’s or victim’s. As a subconscious impulse, the mage drives the Sleeper self to fulfill her agenda. The stolen soul cannot use information it doesn’t know, but it rationalizes a wordless urge to do as the mage wishes. Magic capable of penetrating the subconscious can detect the mage. Investigators can also discover the mage through her sympathetic connections. Spells that manipulate real names and other such bonds retain their efficacy.</div><div>The mage may only absorb one soul at a time. Once the attainment expires, the soul breaks free but is no longer attached to its body. It will attempt to return to its owner, succeeding unless it has been prevented from doing so by supernatural intervention. The soul’s owner remembers it all as a dream, but suffers psychic trauma nonetheless. He loses a point of Morality and must immediately check for a derangement.</div>",

After assigning the individual a name, gender and basic history, the sorcerer spends a Willpower point. With coaxing from the mage’s submerged consciousness, the souls fill in the gaps with combined memories, smoothing over inconsistencies. This unique individual becomes a Sleeper persona, conforming to the rules of the True Masque attainment.

She has access to the Arcana dots she and her victim share in common, limited to the maximum allowed for the soul’s Gnosis. The mage adopts her victim’s aura and Nimbus, but not her sympathetic connections or dedicated magical tools.
