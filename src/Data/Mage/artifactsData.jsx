      "The Mark of Qazalak is a tattoo, although not one that is painted onto the body in the usual manner. It is an actual object that can be peeled from one body and placed onto another, like a piece of cellophane. The current wearer must willingly give it up; it cannot be taken by force, although it can be harmed by attacking its Structure with lethal or aggravated damage, which also causes the wearer to suffer an equal amount of Health points of damage. Attackers suffer a –4 target penalty, however, assuming they can see the tattoo (–5 penalty if it is hidden under clothing, but they have a rough idea of where it is). The Artifact continues to function until all its Structure points are destroyed.",
      "The Mark is a strange, barbed spiral with a hint of a face about the size of a silver dollar, although attempts to pinpoint the exact features of the face always seem to fail. It is believed to come from the Supernal Realm of Pandemonium.",
      "The wearer of the Mark can activate it (a successful Gnosis + Life roll) to gain a contingent power that mimics the Life 1 “Cleanse the Body” spell (p. 180), helping him to fend off drugs, poisons and toxins."

    ],
    'Descrizione': [
      "The first of five Artifacts left behind by the Dethroned Queen, the Ring’s name doesn’t describe what the Artifact looks like, but rather what the Artifact releases when activated. In the shape of a bell clapper roughly nine inches in length, the Ring’s head is spanned along its equator by 10 evenly spaced, small stones: a diamond, ruby, emerald, sapphire, onyx, amethyst, moonstone, amber, jade and aquamarine. On the head’s bottom is a sigil akin to Atlantean glyphs, but not even decipherable to experts in the High Speech.",
      "Activation occurs when the user spends one point of Mana (either her own or the Artifact’s) and taps the clapper against a solid surface — either wood, plastic, metal or stone. While bystanders hear the sound they would expect to hear a piece of metal to make when struck against the selected surface, the user hears a bass-rich tone that reverberates deep within the user’s soul.",
      "Shortly after activating the Ring, the user experiences a sensation that something was cast but is waiting to be processed. This feeling will linger indefinitely until the user decides to cast Mage Sight. Regardless of which Mage Sight spell she casts, the user will instead see that which correlates to her strongest major Arcanum (Storyteller’s choice in the event the two are equal).",
      "<b>Death (Grim Sight):</b> In addition to the standard effects listed for this spell in Mage: The Awakening (see p. 134), the mage also notices that certain people have tags upon their bodies, much like the toe tags used in a morgue. This tag could be wrapped around a finger, an exposed toe or dangling from an ear. Closer inspection of the tag reveals no writing, only a hint. What’s more, the resolution of the tag varies from one person to the next, ranging from hinted (just noticeable) to quite clear (the lines upon which words are written are only slightly blurred).",
      "<b>Fate (The Sybil’s Sight):</b> In addition to the standard effects listed for this spell in Mage: The Awakening (see p. 150), the mage also notices that certain people have more distinct threads than others. How the threads manifest varies, ranging from dragged behind to hanging overhead like the strings of a marionette being put into use by an unseen puppeteer.",
      "<b>Forces (Read Matrices):</b> In addition to the standard effects listed for this spell in Mage: The Awakening (see p. 163), the mage also notices that resonant energy emits a hissing whisper that’s nearly coherent, as if someone were yelling from the other side of a soundproofed door. Again, the effect varies from barely audible to distinctly present, a clear indication that unknown forces are currently at work.",
      "<b>Life (Pulse of the Living World):</b> In addition to the standard effects listed for this spell in Mage: The Awakening (see p. 181), the mage also detects the presence of parasitic infection around the target’s aura. The effects vary from slight discoloration to massive parasitic growth all about the target’s person.",
      "<b>Matter (Dark Matter):</b> In addition to the standard effects listed for this spell in Mage: The Awakening (see p. 194), the mage also picks up a tangible gravitational pull emanating from the target itself. The effects range from light tugging to a weirdly powerful pull that can only be broken if the caster deactivates the spell.",
      "<b>Mind (Third Eye):</b> In addition to the standard effects listed for this spell in Mage: The Awakening (see p. 206), the mage also gleans an unseen presence just outside her field of vision. The effect ranges from shadows just beyond view to “knowing” that a strange being lurks over her shoulder and freezes the caster from looking back. ",
      "<b>Prime (Supernal Vision):</b> In addition to the standard effects listed for this spell in Mage: The Awakening (see p. 221), the mage also sees resonance in a color heretofore never experienced, so foreign, in fact, that the caster can’t even begin to describe it to others. The effect varies from just perceptible to blindingly omnipresent.",
      "<b>Space (Spatial Awareness):</b> In addition to the standard effects listed for this spell in Mage: The Awakening (see p. 233), the mage also perceives a bizarre warping of space seemingly centered on the mass of an influenced subject. The effect ranges from minor tweaks of distance and shape to major warps that could disorient the most talented of Mastigos.",
      "<b>Spirit (Second Sight):</b> In addition to the standard effects listed for this spell in Mage: The Awakening (see p. 246), the mage also sees individuals and locations as “echoed.” The effect varies from hazy outlines trailing behind a person as he walks to multiple mirror images tracing after a person as he walks (or along a building as the user walks by it).",
      "<b>Time (Temporal Eddies):</b> In addition to the standard effects listed for this spell in Mage: The Awakening (see p. 258), the mage also discerns a subtext of time in everything. The effect varies from seeing a shadow of a person’s youth to witnessing a fully fleshed visage of the target as an old man or woman.",
      "All of these skewed perspectives are governed by the relative influence the Exarchs exert upon the target under investigation. People, objects or locations lightly manipulated by the Exarchs trigger the minor effects listed, while those targets strongly influenced by the Exarchs exude major readings.",
      "Or so it seems. The power attributed to the Exarchs by the Ring may in fact be some other Supernal power, the magic of the Seers of the Throne being recast in some way, or it might be an elaborate magical hallucination manipulated at the will of the Exarchs. There is no reliable means to verify the assertion of the Exarchs’ power. What a mage sees with the Ring Sight is clear — what it means is not.",
      "Peering through the fabric of the world to the Supernal stitches underneath is an act of hubris. Mages with Wisdom 7 or higher must make a degeneration roll when this power is used."

If the mage is attempting to scry an astral version of a person or location, then the people or locations in the Fallen World count as a sympathetic connection to their astral counterparts.",
      "Mages can also easily use this item to view Astral Spaces the mages have previously visited. In addition, if a mage places one of these items in physical contact with someone who is traveling in Astral Space, the crystal automatically displays the sights and sounds that the astral traveler is experiencing, allowing individuals who are not traveling astrally to see and hear what the traveler does.

      'A jar full of magical tass wine, when drinking moves you to a temple in a extra-dimentenal space. similar to the Space 2 spell “Follow Through”',
    ],
    'Descrizione': [
      "Most information about the mystical wine called Syrah Atlantide comes from the Oinomanteia of Carolus Strobelius (or Karl Strobl), a 16th-century Austrian mystagogue. Oinomanteia also recounts many other legends and mystical uses of wine. One of the more unusual tales describes the vintage Strobelius dubbed the Dionysian Key.",
      "In brief, the Key is an amphora of Atlantean wine. The stonework jug holds four gallons of potent, spiced wine. Anyone who drinks the wine quickly becomes stupefied and dreams of walking through an Atlantean temple. This is no mere vision, though: the person really has sleepwalked into a shrine built within a bubble of extra-dimensional space. In Strobelius’ account, a group of unwitting Sleepers found the amphora and got drunk. They vanished; one returned, because he sleepwalked out of the extra-dimensional temple again. When he regained consciousness, though, the amphora was gone. Strobelius says he collected the story directly from this lone survivor.",
      "Strobelius’ sorcerous inquiries led him to believe the Atlantean vintage was the key to a portal. The Dionysian Keys acts similar to the Space 2 spell “Follow Through” (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 234); the Earthly terminus of the portal is linked to the amphora. Even a Sleeper can use the Dionysian Key without risk of a Paradox or unraveling from Disbelief, because the Sleeper will be too drunk to count as a conscious witness. Strobelius suspects the Atlanteans may have created other Dionysian Keys to extra-dimensional sites, so he advises Seekers to look for wine-jars when they search Atlantean ruins.",
      "Oinomanteia omits a few details about the Dionysian Key. The relatively small amphora holds up to four gallons of wine, or 16 uses of the Key, since a person must drink at least a quart of the wine to sleepwalk into the temple. Six quarts are already used. Any liquid tass placed in the amphora becomes more wine, so the amphora can be used indefinitely. On the other hand, the wine loses its power within minutes of leaving the amphora, though, so the Key’s owner cannot multiply the mystic vintage indefinitely. The amphora also loses its enchantment if it’s ever empty of the sorcerous wine, and becomes an ordinary (10,000-year-old) wine-jar. Even though the wine is made from tass, the Key does not possess a reserve of free Mana for its owner to call upon.",
      "Strobelius incidentally claims (without giving his reasons) that Dionysian Key vintages can spontaneously appear if wine is made from tass grapes grown on the Hallow that powers an Atlantean site. The connection from the Hallow to the site passes into the grapes, and from thence to the wine. An imbiber may sleepwalk into an extra-dimensional portion of the site, just as with the Atlantean vintage, or the magical wine may provide some other way to bypass wards or guardians. For instance, the wine might impress the words needed to bypass a guardian onto the imbiber’s befuddled brain. In this case, the vineyard itself is the Artifact, though casks or bottles of the wine seldom become Dionysian Keys, and the vintage cannot be regenerated as with the Atlantean amphora.",

Whatever the case, it is uncertain as to who first thought to place sanctified oil within the Flask, or why. Regardless, though, it was at this time that the Flask’s true abilities manifested. Since that time, the plain round Flask, seemingly crafted of bronze and inlaid with elaborate geometric patterns of ivory, has been seen in the hands of a number of different Arrows, all of whom had interaction, at one point or another, with the unquiet dead.",
      "When filled with fragrant oil of a type suitable for anointing a holy person — or the sacred dead — the Flask’s owner can pour out some of the oil on his hands to benefit from a contingent Death 2 “Touch of the Grave” effect, enabling him to interact with objects in Twilight.",
      "One Arrow is said to have scaled a spectral ladder to safety through the use of the Ferryman’s Flask, while another used it to draw a knife out of the ghostly realm with which to defend herself from a Tremere lich intent on harvesting her soul.

By rapping any metal object three times against the surface of the Hound’s Manacle in rapid succession, its wearer can activate a Space 2 “Follow Through” effect, targeting any recent spatial distortion, such as those left behind by teleporting mages.",
      "The six Hound’s Manacles in the Fallen World have been deliberately scattered amongst different Arrows. There were once nine of the Artifacts, but strangely coordinated Seer of the Throne attacks in the late 1980s resulted in the destruction of three of them. The motivation for the attacks was never discovered, and none of the Seer agents were captured. The Manacles — the extant ones and the destroyed ones — are all identical in appearance: a simple band of what appears to be hinged rough iron, which clamps into place on a mage’s wrist with two simple catches that are, nevertheless, quite secure when snapped into place.",

      "Not every Atlantean Artifact has an immediately apparent function. For instance, take this accurate and life-size facsimile of a human skull, beautifully sculpted in solid rock crystal. It weighs 12 pounds. Over the last century, Seekers have found several Artifacts showing similar workmanship, and equally enigmatic purpose. In addition to skulls, these crystal Artifacts have been shaped like demons, predatory animals or other intimidating shapes. Sleepers have also found crystal skulls in Maya territory, but Time magic easily reveals the merely mortal provenance of these objects.",
      "When activated, the Skull glows with a gentle, pale light, as if lit from inside. (an effect that could be duplicated using the Forces 3 spell “Light Mastery”). The light is almost, but not quite, equal to the light shed by a small desk lamp – enough to read by if you’re sitting next to it, and enough to be visible, but not enough to illuminate a large area. The light shines brightest from the eye sockets. The Skull keeps on shedding light until the Skull is deactivated; it spends one point of Mana for each full day of light the Skull generates.",
      "The Skull is certainly a beautifully made sculpture, and its light does have an eerie quality, but what was it for? Some archaeomancers speculate the Crystalline Skull was a ritual object. Others think the Skull was part of something else — a larger Artifact, long since lost or destroyed, or a key to some unknown Atlantean site. Now, however, the Skull has little practical use. The light it sheds is barely enough to make it useful as anything other than a paperweight-cum-desk lamp.",
      "As a result, the Crystalline Skull is at once priceless and worthless (except to a collector of peculiar objets-d’art). Even when an Atlantean relic proves itself less than a revelation, own- ing one still carries great prestige — and what if some cleverer (or luckier) mage discovers the Crystal Skull’s true purpose? A cabal that owns the Crystalline Skull may find the cabal’s mages beset by other mages eager to possess the Skull. A few waggish mages observe that Artifacts such as the Crystalline Skull are most useful as bargaining chips to buy favors from other mages — who don’t know that their new Artifact, while undoubtedly Atlantean, doesn’t actually do anything.",

    'Descrizione': [
      "Centuries ago, a goetic mage developed a terrible rivalry with an astral being that called itself a god. The god’s power was contained in the lone eye set in the god’s forehead — a power that allowed the god to curse all those it saw and bring ruin to its enemies. In order to defeat his opponent once and for all, the mage tore the eye out of the god’s head — but fearing that even this was not enough, the mage proceeded to rip the eye from Astral Space itself and conjure the eye into the Fallen World. Since then, the eye has passed from one mage to another, and its true nature has been forgotten.",
      "The eye — called the Cyclopean Stone by its conjurer — resembles a fist-sized sphere of stone that glitters slightly in the dark. A black spot in the center is the eye’s “pupil,” and its power (equivalent to the Fate 2 spell “Evil Eye”) is triggered merely by pointing the pupil toward a victim and concentrating. Roll Gnosis + Fate and spend one Mana to determine the results.",
      "Carrying the Cyclopean Stone has drawbacks. A person who bears the Artifact must contend with the hatred and jealousy of the eyeless god, and can be tracked unerringly through Astral Space. Theoreti- cally, the Cyclopean Stone would also act as a fetter if the eyeless god ever manifested in the Fallen World. Characters with the Dream Merit suffer even worse — a character who fails the Wits + Composure roll to use Dream receives dreams and visions from the eyeless astral god instead. A dramatic failure causes the character’s astral body to be drawn into the realm of the eyeless god until the dream ends, placing her at the mercy of a vengeful monster."

      '20-sided die, performs minor magical effects when rolled, primarily negative',
    ],
    'Descrizione': [
      "The Die of Destiny is a Supernal Artifact of the Realm of Arcadia, deeply tied to the Arcana of Fate, so thoroughly imbued in the strands of destiny, in fact, that in certain spheres its own fate is impossible to influence with Supernal magic. Its physical form is that of an ancient 20-sided die made of blue-green semi-precious stone, although its durability has been enhanced by virtue of its strong supernatural history. ",
      "The die has an ability not found in other Artifacts. It can be activated by Sleepers — for a price. By concentrating strongly on the act of rolling the die, a Sleeper can pull forth one of the supernatural abilities of the die just as if it was activated by a mage. The Artifact, however, claims a point of Willpower and does a point of bashing damage in the form of a mild electric shock when this happens. Strangely, those who have experienced this phenomena claim that the damage was mildly erotic and slightly addictive, as if the shock struck both pleasure and pain sensors at the same time.",
      "In order to activate the Die of Destiny, a mage must spend a single point of Mana and roll the die onto a flat surface. He receives the same shock and sensation as described above, although it does not do damage to him.",
      "Any attempts to influence the outcome of the roll through the use of natural or supernatural means automatically fail. The die may be targeted for any other purpose, but influencing which facet ends up on top when the die stops rolling is too closely tied to the strands of Fate to be manipulated. Depending on which facet is on top of the activated die when it stops rolling, a variety of effects may be achieved. If multiple rolls are made, the effects accumulate in power or in duration at the Storyteller’s discretion. This can result in overlapping effects, such as Aura Perception in a 360-degree angle or the like, which can be quite disconcerting to those who are not expecting these effects.",
      "1 (Blank) — The character develops the fixation derangement (pp. 97–98, World of Darkness Rulebook) with a focus on rolling the die. Derangement lasts for an hour, but can be stacked for a cumulative time period if this result is rolled again before the first hour has elapsed.",
      "2 (Prime) — The mage loses half his current Mana pool, rounded down. If this effect is triggered by an individual without Mana, this effect targets his supernatural power pool (Vitae, Gnosis, Glamour, etc.), if he possesses one. Sleepers lose Willpower.",
      "3 (Gold) — The character is struck with an exceptional desire for material wealth or acquisition. He must spend a point of Willpower to avoid acting on his heightened greedy desires or instincts. This effect lasts for the remainder of the scene.",
      "4 (Mind) — For the remainder of the scene, the character gains the ability to see auras, per the Mind 1 spell, Aura Perception (p. 205, Mage: The Awakening).",
      "5 (Mercury) — For the remainder of the scene, the character’s Defense is the higher of his Dexterity or Wits. This effect is accompanied by a tendency to react unnaturally strong to emotional stimuli, losing his temper easily, being prone to weeping jags or the like.",
      "6 (Space) — For the remainder of the scene, the character gains 360-degree perception, as per the Space 1 spell, Omnivision (p. 233, Mage: The Awakening).",
      "7 (Copper) — For the next 12 hours, the character exhibits the symptoms of mild hemophilia. Any damage inflicted upon him in one turn is automatically repeated (dealing an equal amount of damage) in the next turn as bruises bleed internally and wounds fail to clot. This damage can be healed through natural or supernatural means, but the effect itself cannot be healed or cancelled through magical or mundane methods.",
      "8 (Spirit) — The character attracts the attention of a hostile, but low-rank spirit of a type appropriate for the area. Although this is a spirit, rather than a ghost, Storytellers may use the traits for Poltergeist on pp. 215–216 of the World of Darkness Rulebook, or may create their own, as they see fit.",
      "9 (Silver) — Any disease or illness from which the character is currently suffering is healed. This effect can cure any mundane (non-supernatural) disease from AIDS to the common cold, but cannot affect injury or age-related debilitations.",
      "10 (Matter) — For the remainder of the scene, the character gains the benefits of Mage Sight, as per the Matter 1 spell, Dark Matter (pp. 194–195, Mage: The Awakening).",
      "11 (Salt) — All previously-acquired effects still active are immediately cancelled. Effects which took place but are not active (healing, the presence of a spirit, etc.) remain. Only ongoing active effects are cancelled.",
      "12 (Forces) — The character’s perception of light and sound is increased to a disturbing level. Due to distraction, the character is at a –2 dice penalty to any action attempted while this effect is in place, and all Perception-based rolls are made at a –4 penalty for the effect’s duration. The character makes an unmodified Stamina roll at the beginning of each turn. The effect remains in place until he achieves a success.",
      "13 (Iron) — The character’s Willpower pool is wholly refreshed.",
      "14 (Time) — For the next 24 hours, all extended actions take twice as long as normal. Double the time that each roll represents.",
      "15 (Tin) — The character’s work with others blossoms. For the next 24 hours, any joint efforts he makes in conjunction with another character or characters receives a cumulative +1 die bonus for every character involved (including himself). These include teamwork actions (see p. 134 of the World of Darkness Rulebook), group rituals or the like.",
      "16 (Life) — The character ages 5 years instantly.",
      "17 (Lead) — An inanimate object of negligible size currently worn or carried by the character is transmuted into gold.",
      "18 (Death) — For the remainder of the scene, the character takes on the physical appearance of a corpse, with pale skin, sunken eyes, and a general demeanor of death and decay. All non-Intimidation Social rolls are made at a –2 penalty for the remainder of the scene. All Intimidation based rolls are made at a +2 penalty.",
      "19 (Sulfur) — For the remainder of the scene, the character can see, hear and speak with ghosts in the Twilight, as per the Death 1 spell, Speak with the Dead (p. 135, Mage: The Awakening).",
      "20 (Fate) — The Storyteller makes two rolls of the die. The effects of both secondary rolls come into play. If both rolls are the same, the duration or intensity of this effect is doubled, at the Storyteller’s discretion.",

Its gunmetal sheen may be dull and its ivory handle no longer bright, but it still fires as smoothly and as accurately as it ever did in the old days.",
      "As an artifact and a weapon, the Peacebringer is designed to bring peaceful rest to anyone possessed by a spirit or ghost. Failing that, it’s still a gun and can give the host another sort of peace. The activation for this effect, which is much like the Spirit 3 “Exorcism” spell, requires someone to load the gun with proper ammunition and fire it at the unfortunate, possessed mortal. Roll an attack as normal. A character attempting to do as little damage as possible should aim for a leg or an arm. If the activation roll (which is concurrent with the Firearms roll and reflexive) is successful, the possessing spirit or ghost is ejected from the subject’s body."

    'Descrizione': [
      "The magical vestments that allow control of the weaksouled, granting the Seers the ability to wear the bodies of innocent Sleepers like clothing, are central in many Pentacle accounts of the Ministries. So ubiquitous are they in stories of the Seers that many Consilii have a hard time believing their Seer rivals aren’t constantly using such Artifacts against them.",
      "The reality is that signature item or not, Profane Vestments are still priceless Artifacts of Supernal origin, and are somewhat more rare than the Pentacle supposes. Each Vestment bears the Seal-name of a particular Exarch. The Seers believe they are directly linked to their creators. A pylon that possesses a Vestment guards it jealously, using it in rites and oblations directed toward the patron Exarch whose Seal it bears. All ten permitted Seals have been witnessed, though the Greater Seals — particularly the Eye and the Father — grant more of these Artifacts to their followers than their lesser brethren do.",
      "Vestments are all unique in design, though they share some common characteristics. They are usually worn draped over the shoulders — most examples take the form of short robes, cloaks, cloth breastplates or tabards though chains of office and scarves are also known. They are decorated with gemstones or sewn-on plates marked with arcane symbols and incorporate intricate patterns incorporating runes of the High Speech, with part of the Seal-Name of the Exarch granting them picked out or highlighted in some way. Vestments always have two powers at minimum — a spell to monitor the actions of a slave and another to influence those actions — and some are more powerful than others. The three most commonly seen power sets were codified by Seers of Paternoster centuries ago during their ascendancy to power and named after the biblical raiment of Israelite priests — the Ephod, Urim and Thummim.",
      "A Profane Ephod costs five Artifact dots and is capable of casting “Aura Perception” and “Emotional Urging”. Profane Urims (the least rare Vestment) cast “Telepathy” and “Telepathic Control” and cost seven Artifact dots while Profane Thummim cost eight Artifact dots and cast “Telepathy” and either “Possession” or “Psychic Domination”. Some Urim and Thummim are capable of also casting “Read the Depths” at the cost of an extra Artifact dot. All Vestment powers are concentration-based and cast at sympathetic range using the Seer’s own sympathetic connection to the pawn being manipulated.",
      "Variants include versions of the common three that can grant their powers to multiple Seers at a time, ones granted by the Psychopomp that can control Ghosts or the Nemesis to control Spirits (each plus one dot) and the Shrouds of Observation used by the Panoptic Ministry to create Grigori (discussed in Chapter Four, page 215).",
      "The Vestments are named “Profane” as they deal with the control of the Fallen world’s inhabitants. Seer legend holds that the Exarchs themselves wear similar robes, referred to as the Sacred Vestments, which allow the puppeteering of the Awakened (see Reign of the Exarchs for an example of such an Artifact) and that the Profane Vestments are mortal reflections of these. Other Seers note that the Gate could create Vestment Artifacts just as well as his fellows, and wonder what powers such a thing would have."

Each piece of the Jewelry is made from gold with an opal setting and is simple, yet elegant, in design. Known pieces of the set include a pair of small hoop earrings, a necklace, a pair of rings and a barrette. Awakened scholars who have studied the Jewelry suspect they were crafted in Arcadia, but have been unable to find any mention of a Queen Sorra in various histories or grimoires to explain the name of the set. Some of these scholars theorize that Queen Sorra may not have been a mortal, Sleeper or Awakened ruler, but rather one of the mysterious inhabitants of Arcadia itself. These scholars also believe the Jewelry might manifest completely different powers in the Realm of Enchantments.",
      "When two or more allied mages wearing pieces of Queen Sorra’s Jewelry cast spells within sensory range of each other, any spell cast with an area effect gains the Fate 2 effect “Target Exemption” (see p. 154 of Mage: The Awakening) with relation to an ally also wearing a piece of the set. Spells affected by the Jewelry do not count as Combined Spells, and they do not suffer the –2 penalty for exempting a specific target. Jewelry owners may choose not to exempt themselves from an area effect spell (cast by a similarly equipped ally) as a reflexive action by spending one Mana.",
      "Example: Three Jewelry-owning cabal members are fighting multiple enemies in a small room. One of the cabal mages casts the spell “Control Gravity” (see p. 176 of Mage: The Awakening) and gains four successes on his casting roll. Normally, anyone caught within a eight-yard radius would be subject to the effects of the spell, but since all the mages present are wearing pieces of Queen Sorra’s Jewelry, none of the mage’s friends are affected, only his enemies.",

These items are always found  in the Fallen World, but some mages believe that the rings originally came from the astral realm. Each of these rings is designed to be worn by one person; wearing more than one ring has no effect. Also, the rings are more effective when worn by multiple individuals. When only one person wears a ring, it provides nothing besides a point of Mana from its Mana storage for the transition into the astral realm. The rings provide two additional benefits when multiple people attempting to enter Astral Space together all wear them.",
      "Any group of people wearing these rings automatically enters Astral Space together. Instead of having to find each other at some destination, they travel together and always have a general sense of each other’s location while in Astral Space. This sense serves as the equivalent of an Intimate sympathetic connection for purposes of using Space spells to observe or travel to one another while in Astral Space. In addition, the ring wearers can use the Teamwork rules (see the World of Darkness Rulebook, p. 134) for the meditation rolls needed to enter the various levels of Astral Space. As a result, moderate-sized groups wearing these rings have a far easier time entering Astral Space and making their way to the Temenos or the Dreamtime."

The sigil remains as dark and vibrant as the day it was sewn, though the white cloth around the sigil is a patchwork of a wide variety of overlapping shades of off-white, brown and gray stains. The Banner is said to be watched over by an extremely formidable cabal of Masters, all former Adamant Sages, who are sworn to defend the Artifact against all of the Adamantine Arrow’s enemies, even at the cost of their own lives. One — or perhaps a recent predecessor — enchanted the ancient and fraying Artifact so as to keep it from further harm.",
      "When raised on high, atop a banner pole, to a height of no less than 15 feet (necessitating the full carrying capacity of any save the strongest mage), the Adamant Banner provides the following benefits to all those willingly under the command of a righteous Arrow: Life 3 “Honing the Form” for Stamina and Mind 2 “Emotional Urging,” creating feelings of confidence, heroism and the rightfulness of one’s cause. Of course, what constitutes a “righteous Arrow” (by the estimation of the Adamant Banner’s creators, anyway) is uncertain, and treatises have been written within the order upon the subject. During some battles at which the Banner was unveiled by hated generals fighting for unpopular causes, its magics spurred those under the Adamantine Arrow’s command to victory, while well-loved commanders in the pursuit of what all involved believe to be a just cause occasionally found that its magics could not be invoked.",

Some Arrows believe that the Banner will serve as the rallying point for the heirs to Atlantis during some apocalyptic battle, while others maintain that the Banner will show the way back to the Supernal, and still others cleave to different tales of the ultimate fate of the Banner and those who march under it."

    'Descrizione': [
      "One of the most terrifying astral artifacts is the Astral Bubble. Existing only in Astral Space, this Artifact can only be acquired from an astral archetype of at least Rank 5, but the only way to acquire one is to do a significant favor for one of these potent beings. Astral Bubbles always takes the form of transparent sphere about the size of a plum that looks much like small but heavy glass Christmas ornaments.",
      "To use this item, the owner must spend a point of Mana and physically throw the bubble at the target, who cannot be a native of Astral Space. This Artifact can be used on spirits and ghosts as well as on the astral bodies of mortal visitors. If this Artifact strikes the target, the target is allowed a single Composure + Wits + Gnosis or Finesse + Resistance roll. If the subject rolls five or more successes, the Astral Bubble bounces off them and reappears instantly in its owner’s hand. If the subject rolls fewer success, the bubble slides seamlessly and painlessly inside the target, coming to rest in the center of the target’s body. The bubble causes no discomfort and has no affect on the target until she attempts to leave Astral Space.",
      "Any human, spirit or ghost that has been affected by an Astral Bubble cannot leave Astral Space by any means. As a result, mages and other living humans in Astral Space who have been struck by one of these items cannot wake up — their bodies remain in a coma until they are released or someone uses a spirit or other being to possess their bodies. The subject can act normally in Astral Space, but cannot leave.",
      "The only ways to remove this bubble and leave Astral Space are for the target to obtain the aid of an archetype of Rank 5 or higher. Such beings can easily remove the bubble, and may be convinced to give it to subject. Alternately, the subject can convince the bubble’s owner to remove it. In both cases, doing so requires that the archetype or owner touch the subject and roll a single success on a Composure + Wits (or Power + Finesse) roll. If this roll succeeds, the bubble appears in the being’s hand, and the subject is free to leave Astral Space normally.",
      "Although Astral Bubbles exist only in Astral Space, unless in use, they automatically return to the owner’s Oneiros, where the owner can automatically retrieve the bubble if she travels through her Oneiros on the way to the deeper portions of Astral Space. If the owner travels into an Astral Space without first going through her Oneiros, she can call the Astral Bubble into her hand by making an extended meditation roll with a target number equal to the difference between the meditation target number for her Oneiros (12) and the target number of the plane of dreams she currently occupies. The owner can make one roll per turn on this task. Becoming the owner of one of these items involves first acquiring it, and then making a successful meditation roll and spending a point of Mana and a point of Willpower. If someone wrests an Astral Bubble from the grip of the bubble’s owner, the new owner can gain control of it by making a contested meditation roll and spending a point of Willpower and a point of Mana. The owner must also make this roll but need not spend either Willpower or Mana. If the prospective thief succeeds, he is the Astral Bubble’s new owner. If he fails, he is automatically affected by the bubble, without the need for the current owner to spend a point of Mana."

The weapon is 18 inches long, a foot of that consisting of a slender, narrow blade made of some mirrored black metal. The blade curves outward into a very slight leaf shape at the tip. The small cross-guard and egg-shaped pommel are of a slick-looking red metal or stone, and the grip is the color of ivory, with the consistency of worn sharkskin.",

Ley Markers set ley lines upon new paths, reconfiguring their shapes, similar to the “Ley Shift” spell, above. Unlike that spell, their effects cannot be dispelled.",
      "Much like magnets, Markers can repel or attract a ley line depending on the Marker’s “programming.” Those of a “positive” nature attract lines: once one is placed (see below), it will draw the nearest ley line to it like a magnet draws a paper clip. Those Markers of a “negative” nature repel lines.",
      "A Marker is placed by burying it halfway in the ground, so that half of it sticks out and half is underground. Once that happens, the Marker is automatically activated and begins exerting influence on nearby ley lines (any line within 25 yards of the Marker), either attracting or repelling them. The Marker spends its own Mana, one per line it anchors. The Markers do not have to be visible to work; they can be covered by another object. In the past, mages sometimes buried them as part of the foundation of buildings.",
      "By using a series of Markers, a mage can weave ley lines in any configuration she desires, provided she can keep the Markers from being removed. When this Merit is purchased, it comes with five Markers.",
      "When a Marker is removed, the lines it controlled snap back into their natural shapes, a phenomenon that will rarely go unnoticed by those with active Mage Sight. Lines that have been marked for a very long time, however, are said to remain in their marked configuration.",

It is nearly microscopic, but it is possible to discern that the mountain is sharp, and the man is bleeding. Hanging from the hilt by a short silver wire is a diamond of great worth.",
      "A mage may activate this artifact by spending one point of Mana, cutting herself and letting some drops of blood wet the katana’s edge. She must be outside, and being higher than her surroundings (on a hill or on the roof of a building) adds one die to the roll. If she is successful, the gem in the hilt shines brightly, lighting the area. Within minutes, a spirit appears to her in a burst of fire and light. The spirit is vaguely humanoid in form, with dark embers for eyes within its shining, burning face, and it is difficult to look at directly. If the mage gives orders, the spirit obeys them to the fullest extent possible, returns to announce completion and departs. Otherwise, the spirit leaves after a minute of silently staring at its would-be master.",
      "There is no limit to the number of spirits a mage may summon and command at one time beyond her capacity for spending her Mana and her blood. The spirits are far from temperate or subtle, and their unrestricted use is sure to earn a great deal of attention. A character may command a spirit to practice stealth as a means to a goal, but the spirit is unlikely to do well following that route."

Certain Guardians sometimes keep special libraries of minute fragments and photographs of powerful items and important books for just this purpose. Although they always attempt to actually recover such items first, if doing so proves impossible, they consult their library and destroy it from a distance.",

Such links often include photographic negatives scrounged from garbage cans, a few hairs from the unicorn’s mane that were plucked off the owner’s sweater or similar traces.

The ungainly but strangely beautiful BijDava (“medicine seed”) was once used as a medicinal aid. When a mage activates the device and points the opening of the “pod” at an injury, the BijDava sends out a warbling, multi-tonal hum that heals the wound. This effect duplicates the Life 3 spell “Healing Heart,” as if cast by someone with Life 5, thus healing bashing, lethal and aggravated wounds.",
      "The device has to be about three feet away from the patient, and has to be directed by the mage who has activated the device for as long as the patient’s wound take to heal.",
      "One point of Mana from the BijDava’s reserve heals three bashing or one lethal wound. Healing one aggravated wound costs two Mana. If the patient suffered different kinds of Wound levels — for example, he’s suffered two aggravated wounds, one lethal wound and four bashing wounds — the device heals the Health levels on the right first, and expends Mana separately for each wound. In this example, the BijDava would expend seven points of Mana (one for the first three bashing wounds, one for the remaining bashing wound, one for the lethal wound and two each for the two aggravated wounds). Each Wound level takes one turn to heal, no matter how serious the wound is. The BijDava doesn’t heal Resistant Damage. During the High Atlantean Age, mages apparently never suffered from this kind of damage; the makers of the BijDava had no conception that such a thing could exist."

    'Descrizione': [
      "This powerful and dreaded Artifact hasn’t been seen by a reliable witness for decades, but those who know of it firmly believe it awaits use in some Guardian vault or subbasement. Whether or not that’s true, the simple threat that the Coffin might be utilized is sometimes enough to convince a mage to cooperate with a Guardian’s agenda. Karnacki’s Coffin — whether it’s named for the first mage to discover it, or for the Artifact’s first victim, is a matter of debate — has been described by those who’ve seen it as a simple pine box, with rusted hinges and more than a few nicks, gouges and cigarette burns scattered across its top and sides. The Coffin is usually accompanied by a set of chains and a padlock, but these are mundane objects that are replaced as needed.",
      "Though the Coffin seems almost fragile, anyone locked inside will find that, like many artifacts, the Coffin is much sturdier than it looks. Its built-in latching mechanism can only be opened from the outside. Breaking out of the closed Coffin requires that the victim deliver damage in excess of the device’s Structure. If the Coffin is chained and padlocked as well, its Structure is effectively increased by four or five more points. (Each attack on the Coffin must achieve more successes than the Durability rating of the Coffin, or the combined durability of the Coffin and chains. See the World of Darkness Rulebook, pp. 135–138.) The Coffin’s latch is easily opened from the outside, though any locks, chains or other security devices must be removed or defeated first.",
      "Mere confinement, however, is the least of the Artifact’s purposes. When activated, Karnacki’s Coffin subjects whoever’s inside to the Space 5 “Oubliette” spell. The victim of the spell is tormented by horrific hallucinations and distortions in space and time. The mage who utilizes the coffin must spend one Mana and roll Gnosis + Space 5 to activate it, and then makes repeated rolls against the victim’s contested Composure + Gnosis rolls. Each successful roll by the tormentor reduces the victim’s Willpower by one point; at zero Willpower the victim becomes a traumatized wreck (see the spell description for details). If the victim successfully contests any of the rolls, he’ll endure the ordeal with his faculties intact (the tormenter will have to activate the Coffin again for another attempt).",
      "As with the spell the Artifact mimics, use of Karnacki’s Coffin is likely to degrade a mage’s standing on the path of Wisdom. But the Artifact holds another danger. Any mage who activates the Coffin becomes subject to a geas, per the Fate 5 “Chains of Fate” spell. The terms are simple: the mage must enter the coffin and subject himself to its terrors, or suffer the consequences. The mage can resist the imposition of the geas with a reflexive Resolve + Gnosis roll versus the coffin’s roll of Gnosis + Space 5 (using the activating mage’s own Gnosis). Should the Coffin win, the mage will be affected by a geas of indefinite duration that begins to exert its effects as soon as the Coffin’s current victim is removed. What makes this phenomenon all the more difficult is that, should the mage willingly place himself in the Coffin, he himself cannot activate it. He’ll need to recruit another mage to help him fulfill the geas — which in turn exposes that mage to the risk of the Artifact’s curse. The fact each use of the Coffin could entangle a chain of willworkers in this manner, rather than the moral implications of the use of torture, is likely the biggest reason that the Guardians are loathe to use it."

Anyone who can see either the orb or its light, or who has the light from the orb fall on any portion of his bare skin is affected by the Mind 3 spell “Eternal Now,” which removes his ability to form new memories while he is within the orb’s light. Only individuals who are also touching the orb are immune to this effect. A pair of people who each kept one hand on the orb at all times could yell at the top of their lungs and violently shove their way through a crowd, and the people in the crowd would forget about this pair the moment they were out of sight. Also, no one who is not touching the orb ever remembers anything about seeing it. Placing the orb in a light-tight bag or box instantly cancels its effect.",

One of the most persistent stories about the Orb of Amnesia is that the loss of ability to remember is not its primary purpose or perhaps not even related to its actual purpose. Instead, some stories about this Artifact claim that it is only one part of a larger, more complex and far powerful Ar- tifact that was disassembled into various parts millennia ago. No one knows what this original item did or where the other pieces are, but the deep carvings on the orb suggest that it might have been able to fit into a holder in some larger object."

So ubiquitous are they in stories of the Seers that many Consilii have a hard time believing their Seer rivals aren’t constantly using such Artifacts against them.",
      "The reality is that signature item or not, Profane Vestments are still priceless Artifacts of Supernal origin, and are somewhat more rare than the Pentacle supposes. Each Vestment bears the Seal-name of a particular Exarch. The Seers believe they are directly linked to their creators. A pylon that possesses a Vestment guards it jealously, using it in rites and oblations directed toward the patron Exarch whose Seal it bears. All ten permitted Seals have been witnessed, though the Greater Seals — particularly the Eye and the Father — grant more of these Artifacts to their followers than their lesser brethren do.",
      "Vestments are all unique in design, though they share some common characteristics. They are usually worn draped over the shoulders — most examples take the form of short robes, cloaks, cloth breastplates or tabards though chains of office and scarves are also known. They are decorated with gemstones or sewn-on plates marked with arcane symbols and incorporate intricate patterns incorporating runes of the High Speech, with part of the Seal-Name of the Exarch granting them picked out or highlighted in some way. Vestments always have two powers at minimum — a spell to monitor the actions of a slave and another to influence those actions — and some are more powerful than others. The three most commonly seen power sets were codified by Seers of Paternoster centuries ago during their ascendancy to power and named after the biblical raiment of Israelite priests — the Ephod, Urim and Thummim.",
      "A Profane Ephod costs five Artifact dots and is capable of casting “Aura Perception” and “Emotional Urging”. Profane Urims (the least rare Vestment) cast “Telepathy” and “Telepathic Control” and cost seven Artifact dots while Profane Thummim cost eight Artifact dots and cast “Telepathy” and either “Possession” or “Psychic Domination”. Some Urim and Thummim are capable of also casting “Read the Depths” at the cost of an extra Artifact dot. All Vestment powers are concentration-based and cast at sympathetic range using the Seer’s own sympathetic connection to the pawn being manipulated.",
      "Variants include versions of the common three that can grant their powers to multiple Seers at a time, ones granted by the Psychopomp that can control Ghosts or the Nemesis to control Spirits (each plus one dot) and the Shrouds of Observation used by the Panoptic Ministry to create Grigori (discussed in Chapter Four, page 215).",
      "The Vestments are named “Profane” as they deal with the control of the Fallen world’s inhabitants. Seer legend holds that the Exarchs themselves wear similar robes, referred to as the Sacred Vestments, which allow the puppeteering of the Awakened (see Reign of the Exarchs for an example of such an Artifact) and that the Profane Vestments are mortal reflections of these. Other Seers note that the Gate could create Vestment Artifacts just as well as his fellows, and wonder what powers such a thing would have."

The Robe even hid the town from the destructive resonance of hype and excess popularity that sometimes consumes such small towns. Thus the easy-to-miss hamlet became the hiding place of an ancient artifact simply by not attracting attention to the artifact’s inherent powers of occultation.",

It has a complex, almost medieval pattern to it, like a knitted Book of Kells, with Atlantean runes in place of Latin letters. It’s length and cut resembles a Greek Orthodox vestment more than any Classical garb typically associated with it in myth. Some speculate, however, that the Robe has been gradually changing its style and form over the centuries to better keep itself hidden from the notice of the Exarchs.",

Once this power has been activated, no Mana can be spent within this zone. The Duration of the zone is Prolonged.",

Regardless of what Arcana a mage knows, as long as she holds the Scepter she can cast Counterspell against a Seer of the Throne or other willing servant of the Exarchs. If she has no dots in the appropriate Arcanum, she rolls her Gnosis alone. The Scepter merely makes it possible for her to Counterspell by keying in on the Supernal magic of the spell, rather than its Arcanum.",

      "This Soma is that from Hindu myth. The Rig Veda describes it thusly: “We have drunk Soma and become im- mortal; we have attained the light, the Gods discovered.” In legend, true Soma is no longer accessible by mortals for the gods have removed it from this world. However, it is believed that some mages possess the capability of apologizing to the gods (and using magic and perhaps entheogens to ensure that the apology reaches their dis- tant or alien ears) and thus once again gaining access to the powerful divine drink of Soma. Assume that those seeking Soma must brave a number of dangers to find it. The Soma is always guarded by a door that only those under the spell of a psychoactive substance will recognize as a door. The mage must apologize to the door using passages from the Rig Veda to access.",
      "The artifact itself is a small urn filled with the golden liquid. The artifact contains enough for only two drinks. Once imbibed, the artifact is rendered null (though some say that the urn itself is perhaps a whole other artifact).",
      "The immortality posited by this drink is not so simply a measure of man’s length of life, but instead refers to the nature of divinity. Divinity is everlasting, even if the body is not. This drink allows the imbiber to reach one of the general goals of the entheogen cults, which is a kind of evolution.",
      "Upon taking the drink, the Soma is permanently bound to the blood and soul. The mage may, once having consumed the Soma, choose a single legendary or mythical shape (see both Life ••••• spells Fantasia and Greater Shapechanging for ideas) for herself. This shape, once chosen, is coded into her blood, written upon her soul with the raw fire of godliness. Once per day, she can change into this shape for a single scene. This is persistent and does not end, providing a permanent benefit to the mage until the end of her life. She has, in some way, transcended her humanity and become something akin to the immortal gods who delivered Soma."

Whenever the Artifact deals two or more levels of damage to an Awakened opponent, Soul Hammer flashes with arcs of power that boil the Mana contained in the mage’s Pattern. For each strike that deals the required damage, remove a dot of Mana from the mage and roll an additional five dice of lethal damage against the target. Damage caused in this way may not be mitigated by armor or Defense.",

The simplest explanation for this is that no mage has survived such an encounter."

The magical science behind such things is assumed lost, but there is one dedicated team of Seers eager to recreate their forebear’s success.",
      "A pylon of unaligned Seers retrieved the Temenotic Obelisk from the heart of an Atlantean shrine deep in the Inner Worlds in 1996. Those Seers have now declared themselves a Ministry, with allegiance to the Unity, though they are not allied with Hegemony.",
      "The Obelisk is a crude but potent means of exerting low-level mental influence over a human population. It appears to be a ten-feet high stone obelisk, capped with a steel pyramid and carved with faintly glowing runes in the High Speech that, translated by the Seers, prove to be partial instructions along with a dedicative phrase offering glory to the Kings of Atlantis. It weighs several tons, though in the dream-logic environment of the Astral Realms there are ways to move such an object.",
      "When brought to the Astral representation of a community or place, the Obelisk can be commanded to take root by casting a modified “Telepathy” spell conjoined with the Matter Arcanum on it and mentally ordering it to activate. The Obelisk then casts a spell based on “Dimensional Axis” to merge that Temenos realm with another of the user’s choice, the activation roll being modified by the user’s sympathy to the target realm. Once the Axis has formed, the spell uses Mind and Prime magic to merge the resonance of the two areas, resulting in the community realm being flooded with foreign emotions and concepts. Back in the material world, everyone within the purview of the realm being warped is affected as though a spirit with a Power + Finesse dice pool of 8 were using the Strengthen Influence to instill the required emotion, including the contested roll. The effect is Prolonged, lasting a week until the Obelisk shuts off. After experiments with using the Obelisk to link a prison with a Temenos realm of peace, and linking the Temenos ideaform of a particular village in France with a Temenos realm dedicated to the concept of betrayal, the Seers are preparing to move it again and are searching for a viable target."

The largely nondescript urn (three-and-a-half feet tall, narrow, and of a neutral beige material akin to ceramic) was traded between mages of the Ladder for several years until, finally, a member of the order in New York City managed, by luck, a bit of Fate and Mind magic, and some favors owed him by the local Mysterium, to translate the tiny glyphs etched around its base. This mage, a Shaman known by the Shadow Name of Slander, figured out how to activate the urn’s amazing power in the late 1980s. Sadly, he was killed shortly thereafter, and the Artifact was moved out of Slander’s Consilium by the Silver Ladder out of fear that the Thyrsus’ assassination was part of a plan to acquire the Celestial Urn. Its present whereabouts are unknown.",
      "After depositing a handful of human ashes (whether fresh, old or even ancient), nine pomegranate seeds, a teaspoon or so of any fermented alcoholic beverage (the glyphs, according to Slander, specifically called for wine or beer, though similarly prepared potable liquids also work), and a single drop of the willworker’s own blood into the Artifact, the mage may use the Spirit 5 spell “Create Spirit,” crafting a Shadow Realm entity to her exact specifications. This spirit is a persistent creation, lasting for as long as the willworker is the owner of the urn. (In other words, until it is lost, stolen, given away or destroyed.) Whatever spirit the mage creates, however, she’s stuck with it until she is no longer the owner of the Celestial Urn; whereupon, the spirit simply ceases to be. Interestingly, the items placed into the urn are not in any way consumed by the Artifact’s power when used and must be removed from it by other means."

At the same moment, it reappears out of the mirror nearest to its named target, no longer a six-inch glass doll but a precise replica of its victim. All its Physical Attributes are identical to its victim’s, and the doll has five dots in Wits, Resolve and Composure while having one dot in all other Mental or Social Attributes. It has five dots in Brawl, Larceny, Stealth and Weaponry, and Skill Specialties in attacking the named target, which the Artifact uses to approach its victim quietly and kill him.

For example, a Pentacle mage wearing the Crown would gain a +3 bonus to an Intimidate dice pool made against a Storyteller character who was a three-dot Ally or Retainer of a Seer of the Throne.",

Roll Gnosis + Life, and spend one Mana. The cup also possesses an apparently unique ability to restore a person’s soul.

This contingent effect is activated by touching the Bracer on one arm to the other, then pointing. Each blast consumes one Mana, with an attack dice pool of 12. Each success inflicts one Health wound of lethal damage (not aggravated, despite the Mana expended).",
      "More subtly, however, the wearer of the Bracers can use the Forces 3 “Control Electricity” spell (see Mage: The Awaken- ing, p. 168), allowing him to redirect electricity already extant in the area by hand gestures as a contingent effect. This does not cost Mana. Again, the dice pool is 12."

      'A mirror that contain a potent combination of scrying magics that allow to see through space and time',
    ],
    'Descrizione': [
      "This Artifact is one of the oldest treasures of the Mysterium’s vast Artifact collection. The Artifact appears to be a circular bronze mirror approximately a foot and a half in diameter, set in a simple frame consisting of two upright supports that allow the mirror to pivot and a flat base suitable for setting in a desk or table. The frame and supports are carved in a simple but exquisite representation of a type of vine unknown to science and magic. Some mages claim that this vine was once a sacred plant of great importance. Legends dating back to the earliest days of the order claim that this mirror was originally carried from Atlantis shortly before its Fall. Other than the fact that the Mysterium has owned this mirror since the days of its earliest records, nothing more is known about this object since it is immune to all magics (including its own) designed to reveal information about it. However, it can be used to reveal almost any other secret. The mirror contains a potent combination of scrying magics, which duplicate the effects of the Prime 1 spells “Analyze Enchanted Item” and “Supernal Vision,” as well as the Space 2 spell “Scrying” and the Time 2 spell “Postcognition.”",
      "Using this persistent Artifact is quite simple. The mage merely looks into it and concentrates on what he wishes to view, and an image of the desired time or location appears within the mirror. While no roll is required to activate this mirror, the mage must be at least Acquainted with the target (see Mage: The Awakening, pp. 114–115). In addition, mages often require a Composure + Wits meditation roll in order to focus their thoughts sufficiently on what they wish to view. Failing this roll means that the mirror displays something related to the mage’s wishes, but exactly what is displayed is not under the mage’s control. However, regardless what images the mirror reveals, these images also contain a multitude of details about any magics or enchantments on the displayed location.",
      "These properties make the mirror both valuable and useful, but the reason for its almost legendary importance is that it sometimes acts on its own accord. Even when the mirror is not in use, it constantly displays images, typically consisting of a series of seemingly random locations and scenes. Sometimes, a mage will glance in the mirror without considering a target and will see something related to her life or desires within the mirror. This scene can be an image of her past, of a distant place known to her, the location of the object of her keenest desire or possibly just a random image whose meaning she may never learn, but in most cases, it turns out to be scene of great importance to the mage.",
      "Mages often try to cause such images to appear by touching the mirror and not specifying a scene to be viewed. Usually, the mirror simply displays a random scene from the mage’s life; sometimes the mirror reveals an image of what the mage unconsciously hoped or feared to see. However, occasionally, the mirror reveals some scene of great import to the mage. Scholars and archeologists of the Mysterium often request the use of this mirror in the hope that the mirror will reveal the location of what they are seeking, even if they have absolutely no clue of where to find it and lack any connection to the target. On rare occasions, the mirror reveals a vital clue that the mage would have now way of learning or looking for, thus ensuring that the mirror remains one of the Mysterium’s most valuable artifacts."

      "The Null Bomb is a relic from a failed Libertine terrorist cell determined to combat the Seers of the Throne and the Silver Ladder in one devastating attack. The Null Bomb is, simply, a catastrophic Prime spell waiting to be triggered, a potential “dispellation event” on an unprecedented scale.",
      "The whole of the Libertine extremist group credited with the creation of the Null Bomb — supposedly the original Liberati (see p. 62) — was the brainchild of a self-loathing archmage who left the ranks of the théarchs for the Free Council in search of some backward notion of redemption. This archmage, whose name goes unspoken to diminish his power, obsessively pursued knowledge of the Prime Arcanum in the hopes of combating the mistakes of his former brothers in the Silver Ladder. He believed that battles between the Ladder and the Seers of the Throne would lead to disaster for humankind and an end to earthly magic. He envisioned a preemptive strike that would create a null-magic zone across whole metropolitan areas — an anti-magic bomb, of sorts. The Null Bomb was created in 1985 to bring his vision to the Fallen World.",
      "Rumors persist within Free Council cabals that one of the five Null Bombs (one for each point of the Pentacle) believed to have been created by the archmage for his guerillas was successfully detonated in an American city, silently and invisibly disenchanting miles of sanctums and mages (though of course which city was supposedly bombed varies with the speaker). Presuming that the Null Bomb even works, it seems unlikely that one could be detonated without word of its catastrophic effects spreading an unavoidable panic through surrounding Consilii. And so the Null Bomb remains more a thing of superstition and paranoia than a milestone in Pentacle history.",
      "At least one Null Bomb is supposedly kept in a Libertine Lorehouse... somewhere. Two others were reportedly destroyed by the Guardians of the Veil in 1986 after being recovered by mages of the Adamantine Arrow. This leaves, by popular accounts, one Null bomb unaccounted for.",
      "In game terms, the Null Bomb has one of two effects. Under the first option, it is a truly devastating object capable of rendering a wide area (probably no more than 10 square miles — still a serious threat) into a “magic dead zone” (per the “Dead Zone” spell, see Mage: The Awakening, p. 230), and so should only be brought into play as the goal or consequence of a story or chronicle. Alternately, the Null Bomb is a Mana-destroying weapon (again, as the “Dead Zone” spell) that does not prohibit spellcasting but does eliminate Mana from Hallows and mages alike. Roll the Artifact’s rating (eight dice); each success robs every mage in the blast radius of one point of Mana. Beyond that, the bomb creates a dead zone at least one square mile in area."

The ring is believed to originate from the Supernal Realm of Stygia.",
      "The ring’s contingent power is triggered by pointing it at its intended target while speaking the word, “Kneel.” This trigger activates the Artifact’s power, which simulates a combined Death 4 “Enervation” spell (p. 143) and a Mind 4 “Befuddle” spell (p. 213). (Since this is cast at sensory range, it actually simulates the 5th dot versions of the spells.) Successes gained on the user’s Gnosis + Death or Mind (whichever is higher) roll are allocated between the target’s Strength and Resolve Attributes, however the user wishes. If the target is reduced to one dot in both traits, he must kneel before the ring’s user, for he lacks the Strength and Resolve to resist the command (he can rise again next turn, although he still suffers the Attribute loss).",
      "During activation, three Mana must be spent for the user, either from the Artifact’s reserves or from his own pool. The effect lasts for one scene, but the user can increase its Duration by suffering dice penalties on the activation roll. See “Duration,” pp. 118-119.",

    ],
    'Descrizione': [
      "This ancient and strange Artifact is a series of four identical and complexly engraved black stone pillars. Using this persistent item creates an environment in which objects and creatures created using Prime magics, specifically those created using the Prime 5 spells “Create Complex Phantasm” or “Create Tulpa,” can endure indefinitely for as long as they remain within the boundary of the space created by the pillars.",
      "Each pillar is a cylinder six inches wide and six inches high. To use this item, the pillars must be placed in a rough square or rectangle that is no more than 16 yards long on any of its four sides. As soon as any items or being created using Prime magics enter this area, the Duration of the magic creating them is no longer relevant, and the creation endures for as long as the pillars remain active. The pillars only cease to be active if one or more of them is moved more than 16 yards from all of the others — if this happens, or if the object or creature leaves the space enclosed by the pillars, the creation’s Duration continues from the time when it first entered the area bounded by the pillars. If a tulpa created with a Duration of two hours enters this area after an hour of this time had elapsed, even if the tulpa remained inside this area for three years, if the tulpa ever left, it would have another hour of existence remaining. Also, if the tulpa remained outside the area enclosed by the pillars for another 40 minutes and then re-entered this area, the tulpa could leave at any time and still have 20 minutes of existence left.",
      "This item also contains one other property that has caused it to be coveted by many mages who are not experts in Mind and Prime magics. Anyone who meditates within the space enclosed by these pillars can use the spell “Create Tulpa” to create any being he wishes. However, beings created (rather than simple preserved by) this Artifact vanish forever if they ever leave this space or if the pillars are ever moved too far apart. Before this item came into the hands of the Mysterium, it was the cause of several murders, as desperate tulpas wished to obtain it in order to survive, and lonely and inexperienced mages attempted to gain control of it in order to recreate the semblance of a lost loved one."

      "The magical vestments that allow control of the weaksouled, granting the Seers the ability to wear the bodies of innocent Sleepers like clothing, are central in many Pentacle accounts of the Ministries. So ubiquitous are they in stories of the Seers that many Consilii have a hard time believing their Seer rivals aren’t constantly using such Artifacts against them.",
      "The reality is that signature item or not, Profane Vestments are still priceless Artifacts of Supernal origin, and are somewhat more rare than the Pentacle supposes. Each Vestment bears the Seal-name of a particular Exarch. The Seers believe they are directly linked to their creators. A pylon that possesses a Vestment guards it jealously, using it in rites and oblations directed toward the patron Exarch whose Seal it bears. All ten permitted Seals have been witnessed, though the Greater Seals — particularly the Eye and the Father — grant more of these Artifacts to their followers than their lesser brethren do.",
      "Vestments are all unique in design, though they share some common characteristics. They are usually worn draped over the shoulders — most examples take the form of short robes, cloaks, cloth breastplates or tabards though chains of office and scarves are also known. They are decorated with gemstones or sewn-on plates marked with arcane symbols and incorporate intricate patterns incorporating runes of the High Speech, with part of the Seal-Name of the Exarch granting them picked out or highlighted in some way. Vestments always have two powers at minimum — a spell to monitor the actions of a slave and another to influence those actions — and some are more powerful than others. The three most commonly seen power sets were codified by Seers of Paternoster centuries ago during their ascendancy to power and named after the biblical raiment of Israelite priests — the Ephod, Urim and Thummim.",
      "A Profane Ephod costs five Artifact dots and is capable of casting “Aura Perception” and “Emotional Urging”. Profane Urims (the least rare Vestment) cast “Telepathy” and “Telepathic Control” and cost seven Artifact dots while Profane Thummim cost eight Artifact dots and cast “Telepathy” and either “Possession” or “Psychic Domination”. Some Urim and Thummim are capable of also casting “Read the Depths” at the cost of an extra Artifact dot. All Vestment powers are concentration-based and cast at sympathetic range using the Seer’s own sympathetic connection to the pawn being manipulated.",
      "Variants include versions of the common three that can grant their powers to multiple Seers at a time, ones granted by the Psychopomp that can control Ghosts or the Nemesis to control Spirits (each plus one dot) and the Shrouds of Observation used by the Panoptic Ministry to create Grigori (discussed in Chapter Four, page 215).",
      "The Vestments are named “Profane” as they deal with the control of the Fallen world’s inhabitants. Seer legend holds that the Exarchs themselves wear similar robes, referred to as the Sacred Vestments, which allow the puppeteering of the Awakened (see Reign of the Exarchs for an example of such an Artifact) and that the Profane Vestments are mortal reflections of these. Other Seers note that the Gate could create Vestment Artifacts just as well as his fellows, and wonder what powers such a thing would have."

In the case of a Soulgate Tome, this precept takes on literal meaning, as the enchanted volumes project their readers’ spirits across the Gauntlet to explore the Shadow Realm. While sojourning in the spirit realm, the mage can jump from passage to passage through spiritual space via the contiguities of selected narrative. The Mysterium hordes these relics, allowing members with access to a copy to explore the terrible wonders and glorious mysteries of the spirit world.",
      "These Artifacts all appear as extremely old forms of written media, such as books, scrolls or even clay tablets. The magic within duplicates the Mind 5 “Shadow Projection” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 218), triggered by reading any passage of text from the tome.",
      "The artifact also provides readers with instant transport within the Shadow Realm per the Space 4 “Teleportation” spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 241), the Mana for which is paid by the book itself. Readers trigger a jump by writing a narrative description of the intended destination on any surface (or even tracing the words in the ephemeral air with a fingertip, where they linger as luminous calligraphy until the mage finishes and the magic resolves). As Artifacts, Soulgate Tomes are unique and wondrous, with each focused on a particular location within the Shadow Realm. Readers always arrive at that emphasized destination.",
      "It is said that a more sinister variation of this Artifact exists that does not take the reader until the Shadow Realm, but instead conveys his mind into the nightmarish darkness of the Abyss. There, the new arrival draws the attention of the acamoth, who swarm like locusts to tempt and corrupt him with the offer of investments, likely severing his silver cord to force him into negotiation. For obvious reasons, the mages of the Mysterium do their best to keep these cursed texts out of circulation, but the books have a tendency to appear in the strangest of places, using their embedded Space magic to self-teleport to random libraries. Among the most notorious of these tomes are the Manual of the Empty Page and the Tautological Codex of Thule."

The Altar’s top is set with a small orichalcum bowl, while the front is inlaid with a pentagram sigil marked with unknown signs. Each arm of the pentagram holds a socket for a soul stone. The Mysterium has not seen the five symbols in any other context. Some archaeomancers believe the symbols represent the Paths — but not every Seeker believes the Paths existed as such before the Sundering and the appearance of the Watchtowers.",
      "As the name suggests, an Altar of the Hallows functions only when linked to one of these upwellings of mystic power. The Altar is always secluded within the inmost adytum of an Atlantean temple, locked away from the uninitiated and protected by wards, traps and gatekeepers.",

All such Mana harvested is not gained by the mage, however — it likewise is stored within the Altar. To use the stored Mana, one must fill the bowl with pure water, then dip out the water and pour it over a person’s head.

Every miniscule mechanism moves perpetually according to a design as ancient as it is unfathomable by modern science or willwork. If installed within the chest of a person dead for no more than a number of minutes equal to his Stamina (requiring his own heart to be replaced), the Clockwork Heart “restarts” the body without deleterious consequences and the individual benefits from a persistent Life 5 “Regeneration” effect.",

      "Two downsides, one obvious and one less so, accompany the Heart. The first, and more apparent of the two, is that the recipient of the Heart cannot die while it remains within him. No matter what kind of suffering he might endure, he will “die,” only to get back up — quite possibly in time for further torment, unless someone thinks to (or wishes to) remove the Artifact from his body. Secondly, the great heroes that the Adamantine Arrow has saved from death with this Artifact tend to fall into ignominy and even disgrace after receiving this new lease on life. Fate Arcanum perceptions reveal no particular “curse” on the Artifact, but the fact remains that records are sparse regarding any Arrows who go on to do anything worthwhile after being restored to life by this strange device, and presumably, these diminished paragons find a way to end their meandering existences, or else have them ended by circumstance.

    ],
    'Descrizione': [
      "This powerful and unlikely item is one of the stranger relics found in the astral realm. Although this item can on rare occasions be found in the Oneiros, the Dreamtime or even the Shadow Realm, in the vast majority of the rare occasions the item is seen, mages encounter it in the Temenos. Most often, Flying Saucers are seen briefly flying by at high speed, but they occasionally hover mysteriously for a few minutes. On exceptionally rare occasions, mages find one that is damaged and empty, or occasionally with strange half-human inhabitants of varying appearance dead inside. If the mages find a crashed saucer, they can take possession of it. Some mages attack or restrain Flying Saucers in an attempt to either acquire the Flying Saucer or to at least find out what manner of beings are inside. Sometimes these attacks succeed, and the mages will discover either spirits, astral denizens or occasionally other mages inside. No mages are known to have succeeded in capturing a saucer piloted by the original creators, and reports of attempts to do so indicate that the original owners are beings of significant power whose attacks can inflict permanent damage on the mage’s mind or occasionally even harm their target’s physical body. The most common theory is that these beings are inhabitants of one of the Supernal Realms or the Abyss, but no one has ever discovered any information about these beings or the true origin of these Artifacts. All attempts to use magic to do so automatically fail.",
      "Regardless of the Artifact’s origins, or how it is acquired, a Flying Saucer is an Artifact of considerable power. Most are between 30 and 35 feet in diameter and between 10 and12 feet thick. The interior contains space sufficient to hold six passengers as well as the pilot. The exact details of the controls vary from one saucer to the next, but typically consist of flat, brightly colored panels that are touched to control it. The controls are relatively simple, and mages can discover their use through either trial and error or by using of the Matter 1 spell “Craftsman’s Eye,” if the mage also uses Forces 1 with this spell. This vehicle allows the occupants to travel at vast speed through the various Astral Spaces, moving at speeds equal to supersonic jets or futuristic spaceship in those realms where such speeds make sense. The saucer can also travel freely between different realms in the Temenos, requiring no more than five minutes per penalty to any rolls involving connections between realms — for example, traveling between two realms that are related (a –3 dice penalty) requires only 15 minutes. Also, the pilot can even use this vessel to realms that are not connected to one another, as long as the pilot has visited or otherwise has a connection to the realm she wishes to travel to. Journeying between unconnected realms requires only one hour of travel.",
      "This vehicle has two other capabilities. If the pilot wishes and spends one point of Mana, she can cause the vessel to physically appear in the World of Darkness. This appearance is a vulgar act, and the pilot must roll for Paradox. In addition, the ship can remain in the mortal world no longer than two minutes (which is sufficient for up to seven people to enter or leave the vessel). In addition, it can appear no more often than once every 10 minutes. If anyone on board the vessel physically leaves, the instant he leaves the saucer his body vanishes from its present location (where his body was currently in a trance) and appears to be walking out of the saucer. Characters who physically enter the saucer do not physically enter the astral realm; instead their bodies appear in their own beds (or wherever they most commonly sleep) and their astral bodies enter Astral Space inside the saucer. The pilot can cause the ship to appear at any location she has an Intimate connection to. Doing so requires a meditation roll (with a –2 dice penalty because of the sympathetic connection).",
      "Also, if the pilot knows at least one dot of the Spirit Arcanum, she can also cause the vessel to move from the astral realm to the Shadow Realm or Twilight. This transfer also costs one point of Mana, but is not vulgar. If the pilot desires, she can then pilot the vessel through Twilight at a speed of approximately 1,000 mph and cause the vessel to appear in any location in the mortal world she can see using the Spirit Arcanum to perceive the mortal world from Twilight or the Shadow Realm.

Characters who enter Twilight or the Shadow Realm in a flying saucer are psychic projections into either realm, identical to the projections produced by the Mind 5 spell “Shadow Projection.”",
      "Despite the occupants’ non-physical state in Astral Space, Twilight and the Shadow Realm, the saucer allows the owner to physically travel anywhere in the Fallen World, by flying through Twilight and then briefly appearing in the Fallen World. However, one of the problems with this vessel is keeping it, since it cannot be stored in the mortal world, and if left unguarded in the Astral or Shadow Realms, the saucer is likely to be stolen by a mage, spirit or some other being. To prevent this, mages usually either pay or command a spirit or astral denizen to guard the saucer, or protect it with spells such as the Space 4 spell “Pocket Realm,” the Space 5 spell “Hide Space” or the Spirit 5 spell “Spirit Manse.” As a result, only the most powerful mages are likely to be able to retain possession of one of these exotic wonders.",

      "This wondrous and terrifying Artifact has been utilized only sparingly by the Silver Ladder for centuries, as its incautious use easily leads mages astray from the path of Wisdom. Once a generation, it is moved between Consilii under heavy guard — by way of mundane transportation and utterly without fanfare (often in the hands of a cabal whose members have no idea what it is, exactly, they’re carrying) — and entrusted to one or more local théarchs with the resources necessary to keep it safe against the order’s enemies. Interestingly, the Opener of Ways isn’t much to look at: a rod of what appears to be rough and rusted iron (but of a substance that, when held, is clearly of an unnatural hardness and density), hexagonal and approximately 30 inches in length, flaring out very slightly at one end, and blossoming out and opening up at the other end into what appears to be something like a small razorwire cage.",
      "When a Mastigos soul stone is placed within the “cage” at the end of the Opener of Ways (which constricts to hold the stone fast and relaxes to release it), its powers become active. The Artifact may be used to teleport anywhere the mage wishes as a contingent effect — even into (or from) Twilight or Shadow — without Paradox. The soul stone fitted into the Opener of Ways acts something like a Demesne, protecting its wielder from the ravages of any Paradox that would normally result from the Artifact’s powers. If the soul stone is removed, the Opener of Ways again becomes inert. It may also be used to teleport others, with or without their consent, to anywhere in the material world, Twilight or Shadow. If wielded as a weapon (with or without soul stone), the Artifact has a damage rating of 3L. Needless to say, the careless use of this item may easily lead to hubris and degeneration under the best of circumstances."

Shadow and Light is just such an instrument, believed to have been torn from the heart of some hell alien. According to the Adamantine Arrow’s lore, the Artifact has been wielded by some of the most despicable villains in the order’s long history. At present, Shadow and Light is believed to be locked in a vault in a fortified Mysterium Athenaeum somewhere in the Swiss Alps, though that may simply be misdirection on the part of the Arrows who know of the weapon’s existence.",
      "In appearance, Shadow and Light is a long, slender-bladed sword of an unknown whitish-gold metal. It reflects everything with a perfect metallic sheen, though those who look deeply into their reflections note that the eyes of the mirrored images appear dead and soulless. Shadow and Light’s blade curves lightly, to a delicate point, and its hilt is wrapped in matte black wire, while the pommel is small and spherical and of the same substance as the blade. There is no guard.",

In the case of ephemeral beings, each level of damage inflicted by the Artifact’s effect destroys a point of the entity’s Essence in addition to inflicting further damage to its Corpus. Shadow and Light inflicts aggravated damage and conveys an equipment bonus of +5. The wielder of the weapon decides whether to draw Willpower or Mana with each strike. Note that the use of Shadow and Light can easily constitute a sin against the tenets of Wisdom. When the weapon’s powers are successfully used, a cacophony of unearthly screams emanates from the Artifact."

      'An engine that can be attached to vehicles to let them fly at high speed, it uses the pilot mana or life energy to move the vehicle.',
    ],
    'Descrizione': [
      "If some mystics and visionaries are correct, the flying chariots of the Mahabharata, the so-called Vimanas, are a mythic memory of the conveyance of choice for the mage-kings of Atlantis. The Agra Revelations include a brief reference to “the kings’ bright Vimanas.” Someone, at least, built powerful, magical flying machines long ago. The long-dormant wreckage of what, for want of a better word, might be a Vimana lies in the tomb of one Atlantean general. The machine looks like a chariot with wings instead of wheels, elongated and heavily decorated with sigils and scrollwork in metal alloys that don’t exist any more. Unfortunately, a cave-in buried and crushed one side of the machine. It’ll never fly again.",
      "But its engine remains intact. A conical pillar of silver metal supports a spherical cage in which a small, rune-engraved ball of orichalcum floats, suspended in air. The pillar holds spira tubes filled with hermium, or alchemically-perfected mercury.",
      "The whole assemblage weighs 50 pounds. All a mage has to do is remove the engine and attach it by magic to some other conveyance: a boat, maybe, or an automobile. (A version of the Matter 3 spell “Repair Object” would be quite adequate). Attaching the Vimana Engine to a vehicle turns it into a new Vimana. An enterprising mage might, for example, insert the Engine in the place of an automobile’s steering column — the Engine is about the same size and shape, after all. (Other mages may crack jokes about “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” though.) Or the mage could placed the Engine in the stern of a speedboat, where a normal engine and propellor would go. The Engine will not work if placed on any vehicle more than 30 feet long (a small yacht), or weighing more than 20 tons (a light tank).",
      "A mage must touch the engine to activate a Vimana. He becomes its pilot. A nimbus of light engulfs him, and then the vehicle. His perceptions extend to the vehicle. He becomes one with the newly made Vimana. The sensation of being part of the machine is euphoric, blissful, but has its cost; the pilot gains the power of the Vimana, but he also becomes another component of the Engine, and a potential source of fuel.",
      "The Vimana can fly (per the Forces 5 spell “Flight”) and can travel at quite terrifying speeds (as per the Forces 5 spell “Velocity Mastery,” with up to five automatic successes, multiplying the flight speed up to 32 times.) Shooting projectiles from a Vimana is impossible, since the same “Velocity Mastery” effect magic that protects the passengers of the sky chariot from acceleration g-forces also stops things escaping from within the Engine’s magical field. Bullets (or shells, in the unlikely event that anyone would be deranged enough to turn a tank into a Vimana) simply hang at the edges of the Engine’s magical field, then drop to earth when the device lands and the field lapses, all kinetic energy spent. This effect does not inhibit magical attacks.",
      "The Vimana uses a lot of energy. The Mana cost doesn’t depend on the mass of the vehicle; instead, the Engine consumes Mana based on the number of higher life forces present in its field: one Mana per turn per person or animal riding in the machine. For instance, a Vimana containing three mages and a dog spends four Mana every turn. On the other hand, a Vimana containing three mages, a dog and a vampire still only spends four Mana per turn, since a vampire isn’t a living thing.",
      "In the Atlantean age, the Vimanas were handled by vastly powerful mages, with huge resources of Mana. A modern mage just isn’t that powerful. A drain of energy that an Atlantean archmaster would find a minor inconvenience can leave one of the modern Awakened a charred, lifeless husk in a matter of minutes. When the Vimana exhausts its own energy reserve, the Engine draws Mana directly from the pilot. If it takes more Mana per turn than the mage has the Gnosis to spend, the Vimana draws energy directly from the mage’s life force, inflicting one point of lethal damage for every point of Mana the Engine must rip from the mage’s Pattern.",
      "If the mage didn’t have any Mana to begin with, the Vimana draws all the energy as points of lethal damage. The pilot doesn’t feel any pain from this while he’s controlling the Vimana, and must succeed at a roll of Wits + Stamina to notice and break his deadly connection with the Engine. If all the pilot’s Health levels are filled with lethal damage, he still has to roll Stamina to remain conscious every turn (per the World of Darkness Rulebook, p. 173.) If he falls unconscious, he breaks the connection and the field fails.",
      "Other people near the pilot can see his skin blackening and shriveling, and can try to tell the pilot what’s going on; the pilot still has to roll Wits + Stamina to disengage. It takes two turns to bring a fast-moving Vimana to a safe, slow landing. It might take more if the Vimana flies above terrain where it’s unwise to land (for example, a glowing 1968 Chevy Malibu flying above open sea is going to sink if the pilot turns off the mystical engine). A Vimana with a dead, unconscious or disengaged pilot simply drops out of the sky. If there’s another mage in the machine, though, she can try to reactivate the Engine and bring the machine down.",
      "Disbelief can unravel the magic of a Vimana. A Sleeper who sees the glowing, flying Vimana in action rolls Resolve + Composure (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 274). If the cumulative successes from the Sleeper’s rolls exceeds nine (using the Artifact’s dot rating as the Potency of its magic), the Vimana stops working. Even before then, however, the Vimana has to spend an extra Mana each round after a Sleeper rolled successes, on top of the Mana already spent to operate the device, to counteract the effect of Disbelief and keep flying. A mage can probably flee a single Sleeper witness; a crowd will deactivate the magical vehicle in short order. For what it’s worth, UFO enthusiasts may count as Sleepwalkers in this case, at the Storyteller’s option."

      "Legend states that when the Celestial Ladder to the Supernal Realms shattered, mages from both sides were flung back to earth. One particularly powerful Exarch found himself literally falling from the heavens and, temporarily bereft of his magic, failed to save himself before crashing to the ground. The Exarch was hovering on the edge of death when his body was discovered by an exile. Recognizing the Exarch as an enemy, the exile magically ripped the mind and brain of the Exarch from his body in an act of vengeance.",
      "The exile kept the brain alive through magic until she had finished crafting a container for it. The brain was sealed inside a cloudy crystal globe filled with liquid tass and further enchanted to allow the exile to draw information from the preserved organ about the Exarch’s magical repertoire and studies. Later, the mage used the Prime 1 spell “Inscribe Grimoire” (see p. 220 of Mage: The Awakening) to add her own magical knowledge to the Artifact before her death.",
      "The Grimoire passed from mage to mage over the centuries, gathering knowledge and power until one day the Artifact gained sentience and began to speak. Whether this was the ghost of the long-dead Exarch or not is unknown (the Artifact doesn’t seem to know, itself), but the effect on the item was substantial. No longer could the owner of the Grimoire simply peer into the milky depths of the Grimoire in search of spells; the Artifact began to make demands before it would share its knowledge. The owner of the Grimoire of the Exarchs must exchange information for information, either in the form of a spell unknown to the Grimoire or obscure pieces of historical or magical knowledge.",
      "Exactly what the Grimoire of the Exarchs knows, or wants to know, is left for the Storyteller to decide. The Artifact is likely to know all the spells presented in Mage: The Awakening as well as most of the spells found in other Mage sourcebooks. This item is intended to be a Storytelling device, so feel free to broaden or limit the knowledge of the Grimoire as you see fit. There is no reason the Artifact can’t ask for favors beyond those of pure knowledge, either. Perhaps the Grimoire wishes to recover the long-buried remains of its body, or maybe the Grimoire would like to be put to rest. This item provides a source of multiple story hooks and ideas.",
      "Why a Banisher would own, or seek, the Grimoire varies in accordance with how that particular Banisher operates. Many Banishers would no doubt destroy the Artifact without a second thought. However, there are Banishers who would keep the Grimoire to provide them with insight to Atlantean times with an eye toward learning the secrets of the Timori."

      "The Artifact known as the Mask of Eyes is held as an example of the Ministry of Panopticon’s great favor with the Eye, and imitation (non-magical) masks are used by Panoptic Seers in their Oblations across the East Coast of the United States. The true Mask resides in the personal collection of the Tetrarch of Panopticon for that region, used under strict control when the servants of the AllSeeing need to observe something that even Grigori, Profane Thummim and Seer specialists in sympathetic magic cannot bring into view.",
      "The Mask is made of iron, marked on the inside with the 777 names of the Eye in minute scrimshaw and on the outside only with one central eye. There are no breathing holes, and no ribbon or strap to tie the Mask on with — when put to its wielder’s face, the mask adjusts its size appropriately and then merges at the edge with the wielder’s skin. It can be removed by speaking a word of command in the High Speech, but provides for the bodily needs of the user so that they do not starve or suffocate.",
      "The Mask grants the use of a spell of deceptive simplicity. When wearing it, the user concentrates on anything she wishes to view. Her viewpoint then shifts, as though she were using a “Scrying” spell, to the view from the nearest representation of a human eye to the object of the Seers’ scrutiny. Actual living eyes are not eligible (though through experimentation the tetrarch has discovered she can view out of a human eye once it has been removed from the body), though photographs, drawings, statues, people depicted on TV broadcasts, paintings, the Panopticon symbol on US bank notes and even crude eyes of Horus made of makeup all work. The viewpoint can be switched at will, though each (including the first) uses a point of Mana from the Artifact’s supply.",
      "Rather than just being an Imbued Item of “Scrying,” the Mask seems to arrive by its powers through a more complex route that does not obey the known laws of sympathy. The Mask counts as having a “known” sympathetic connection to any image of the human eye, anywhere in the material world, Shadow Realm or Astral Realms; this is the level of sympathy used in its activation roll. Furthermore, it cannot be blocked by spatial wards with a Potency less than 8, “Quell the Spark” or “Dead Zone”. If it creates a Scrying window, it has not been successfully detected — assume that attempts to see the window using “Spatial Awareness” fail. It does trigger the Unseen Senses of anyone in the vicinity of the image being seen out of, and under Mage Sight (4 successes needed on the Intelligence + Occult roll) the eye being watched out of changes and appears to be the eye of the Seer using the Mask.",
      "The Seers that have studied the Mask believe it to have been somehow tied into the symbolic language of the Fallen World in lieu of a normal sympathetic web — clearly the product of archmastery or Supernal construction. That it allows the tetrarch that possesses it to handily spy on any Sanctum of Panopticon, thanks to the prevalence of images of the Fourfold Watcher found in such places, is a large part of that Seers’ personal power. The Mask is loved and feared in equal measure. It could make (and has) a Seer of Panopticon a great leader, but if it were to fall into the hands of their enemies it would be a disaster."

In the ring is set a faintly glowing greenish golden sphere the size of a child’s marble. This stone glows with light sufficient for the wearer to see to a range of 5 meters even in complete darkness. In addition, almost no one can attack the wearer. The ring provides the wearer a persistent and improved version of the “Diplomat’s Protection” spell (p. 200).",

If the attacker has a higher Gnosis or other similarly functioning Trait (such as Blood Potency or Primal Urge) than that of the ring’s wearer, she can attack the wearer. In addition, if the wearer attacks someone (either physically or magically), the victim of the attack can attack the wearer. However, the victim’s friends and allies cannot attack the wearer unless they are also attacked by the wearer. In addition, the stone makes all attacks on the wearer more difficult than usual, as attackers must struggle to overcome their awe and reluctance to attack. The wearer gains the benefit of 3 points of Armor against all attacks by beings that are not wholly mindless.

As one of the only known ways to reliably attract an Exarch’s attention, the Teraphim is kept under heavy guard within the Minister’s Sanctum. The one recorded occasion of it being stolen by an overlyambitious underling saw an ochema manifest to retrieve it. After first being uncovered in the Sahara in the 2nd century, the Teraphim has been passed down from Seer to Seer, always the sign of an individual’s dominance but never the means by which it is achieved — the Teraphim is the tool of a Minister, and one must be a Minister already before safely using it.",
      "The Teraphim is a model of a human man’s head, lifesized and made of some dark ceramic material that looks like terracotta but resists all attempts to mark or damage it. The depiction is exact down to the veins visible beneath the “skin”, and the neck shears off into a flat plane so that the head sits upright on a flat surface. The person depicted is bearded, of vaguely Mediterranean appearance but with features suggestive both of the Indian subcontinent and China that make it impossible to place. The eyes are open, the expression stern to the point of fury and the lips slightly parted as though the head were drawing breath. The Minister believes the person depicted to be the Father, in his mortal incarnation prior to Ascending the star ladder. If so, it is one of only a few representations of an Exarch in life known to exist.",
      "When certain that the Father’s names are spoken, the Teraphim casts “Create Hallow” on its present location, Mana rushing into the Fallen World from the Father’s palace in Supernal Aether as the connection opens. The Teraphim begins to whisper in sibilant sounds that are perceptible as the native language of any persons listening. While the temporary Hallow lasts, anyone present gains the effects of “Prophecy” with five follow-on questions as the Exarch whispers his plans for the world. This is not without cost, however; all present react bodily as though in an ochema’s presence, and the Father’s plans are not requests — anyone using the Teraphim ends the encounter under the effect of a “Swearing an Oath” spell cast with a potency of 10 forcing them to perform the actions outlined in the “Prophecy” spell.",
      "The Teraphim can also be used as the centerpiece of a ritual to summon an ochema of the Father (Rank 5), which takes 15 successes on an extended Intelligence + Occult action. The ritual is not magical, being the means by which this contingent effect of the Teraphim is activated, so it could theoretically be bypassed using “Activate Enchanted Item” but the likely reaction from the ochema summoned means that to date no one has dared. The ochema first delivers direct messages from the Exarch in the form of overwhelming phantasmal visions of Aether filled with religious imagery and is then empowered to answer appropriately servile questions. At all times, it demands the utmost respect from those present. Its patience for beings of the Fallen World — including willworkers — is short."

For a more vicious twist, the Storyteller may also allow players to cannibalize dots from approved traits to apply the experience required to purchase the forfeited dots toward mastering the Eye.

      'A complicated mechanism that transport anyone who can solve an enigma inside a labyrinthic and misterious library outside the normal flow of time.',
    ],
    'Descrizione': [
      "The Metachronal Clock appears as a complicated mechanism of gimbaled rings and gears forged of an unknown golden alloy. The machine automatically unfolds from a coin-sized disk to a vaguely spherical configuration whenever the device is tossed lightly into the air, arresting its ascent and beginning to spin along multiple axes without regard for gravity or inertia. Far from being a mere clever bauble, the clock exists in at least five spatial dimensions and probably many more, folded back on itself to converge in a spacious pocket dimension constructed as a sanctum completely isolated from the dominant continuum of the Tapestry.",
      "The actual Structure rating of the Metachronal Clock is unknown; the object seemingly exists beyond such limitations. Parts consistently shift to replace any bits broken off, and its multiple suband over-dimensional construction appears to be filled with such a variety of additional pieces capable of moving into place to replace what is broken that the mechanism is functionally indestructible. Of course, the fullness of this immunity has never been tested — the Mysterium has no intention of seeing what might happen were a genuine attempt to destroy the mechanism made.",
      "Accessing the pocket sanctum requires a would-be entrant to align the clock’s rings in an exact configuration that changes with every attempt. Solving this enigma requires an Intelligence + Occult roll at a –5 penalty as an instant action, with dramatic failure resulting in the user teleporting to a random and invariably undesired location without the device. However, those clever enough to solve the puzzle jaggedly implode through a vortex that dumps them and any intended passengers in the immediate vicinity (along with the clock’s exterior structure) within its interior folds. Encompassing a labyrinth of chambers and tunnels connected with Escher-like stairwells and doorways built at apparently random gravitational orientations to one other, the sanctum complex houses vast collections of texts on virtually any conceivable subject, providing a +5 bonus to all research rolls and allowing a roll every 10 minutes. However, the amount of actual time spent researching is something of a moot point since events within the Metachronal Clock takes place “off the clock” with no time ever passing in reality from the point that the clock vanishes and reasserts inter-dimensional contiguity. Leaving the clock requires a puzzle solution similar to entrance, which returns the occupant and the clock’s exterior manifestation to the place he left space and time, or else a random non-fatal location in the Tapestry that the user has never visited.",
      "The dots assigned to the Metachronal Clock’s rating assume the machine “only” provides its library, a virtually impregnable sanctum and an extremely powerful teleportation effect. However, the structure’s interior contains many other wondrous enchantments and subartifacts that modern mages barely understand enough to guess their function, let alone operate (such as the fact that the entire structure seems to be alive according to “Life Sense” spells). The clock’s rating should be considerably higher if a Storyteller makes any of these deliberately unspecified functions available as anything more reliable than a plot device.",
      "Within the Mysterium, the Metachronal Clock is viewed with reverence and awe befitting the Artifact’s power and significance as a functional vestige of Atlantis. Only the most high-ranking and trusted members of the order ever get to see the clock, let alone enter it. However, despite its obvious (and not so obvious) dangers, its keepers dare not leave it alone, since every time anyone has attempted to hide it away without exploring it, the clock subsequently translocated itself where a sufficiently curious mage could find it. Whether this behavior is a programmed feature or a sign that the structure has some sense of self-awareness remains undetermined, just as so much else about the machine. Storytellers should certainly feel free to assign whatever motives to the clock serve the story, since the Artifact’s primary purpose within the setting is to facilitate stories about exploring the infinite mysteries of the cosmos. The machine is a game-defining plot point and does not pretend to be anything less, unless of course that’s exactly what it’s doing."

    'Description': [
      "A nine-pointed star, it's a soul stone of powerful mage from atlantis. It can create temporary Demesne and function as a Soul Jar and use the souls for several effects.",
    ],
    'Descrizione': [
      "This Artifact is a nine-pointed star made from what appears to be old, pitted iron. About the size of an soda can, the Star has a cylindrical opening in its base to allow it to act as the headpiece to a staff. The Star emits a low humming noise and is deathly cold when touched with bare skin. If tapped with a hammer, the Star makes a dull ringing sound, indicating the Star is hollow.",
      "The Star is a soul stone (see p. 277 of Mage: The Awakening) supposedly made by a Moros mage from ancient Atlantis with the shadow name of Athichi. The stories about Athichi, supplied by the Mysterium, say he was a powerful and arrogant mage. Athichi enchanted his soul stone with powerful spells, allowing him to increase his mystical energies by simply planting his staff in the ground and activating its power.",
      "Although Athichi had pulled the soul stone from the essence of his own being, he was unwilling to allow it to limit his potential, so he devised a method of powering the stone without having to sacrifice his magical energy. Athichi wove a version of the “Soul Jar” rote (see p. 137 of Mage: The Awakening) into the Star that allowed him to reclaim his essence from the soul stone by using the energy from stolen souls to power the Artifact. To his delight, Athichi discovered the more souls he fed into the Star the more powerful it became, allowing him access to more powerful magic than he had ever wielded before. The accumulated energy of the souls devoured developed into new powers for the Artifact, including, the stories say, the power of immortality.",
      "As the power and pride of Atlantis grew, so grew the power and pride of immortal Athichi. Students came to study and learn from the great mage, and with them, Athichi formed his first cabal. All was well until rumors about the true source of his power began to plague Athichi. Eventually, Athichi found himself confronted by angry mages who called for his execution or exile from the Awakened City. Having no intention of giving up either his life or his citizenship, Athichi and his dark cabal worked behind the scenes, ramping up the level of tension between the faction of mages calling for balance and the faction of mages who saw themselves becoming as gods. When war finally exploded across Atlantis, Athichi and his cabal stood among the victorious mages, free to work their powerful magic without interference.",
      "The remaining mages of Atlantis turned their minds as one toward the heavens, and cast a terrible spell that tore a direct path to the Realms Supernal. Among the first to climb the Celestial Ladder was mighty Athichi, and he fed the Star with energies stolen from the powerful beings defeated by the mages as they stormed the Supernal. For a time, the mages ruled the world from on high, realizing their dreams of godhood. But mortal man was never intended for such heights, and soon reality began to distort and crack. As the world began to spiral toward chaos and destruction, the exiled mages banded together and attacked Atlantis, climbing the Celestial Ladder to assault the Celestial mages on their stolen thrones.",
      "Adamantine Arrow legend states that Athichi fought against this incursion, staff in hand, with the Star radiating a dull black light, until a heroic member of the Ungula Draconis managed to wrench the Star from Athichi’s staff and fling the Star back to Earth. Howling in fury, Athichi destroyed the brave Talon and was preparing to summon the Star back to him when the Celestial Ladder exploded, severing the Supernal from the mortal world.",
      "Where the Star came to rest in the Fallen world is unknown, but rumors about its reappearance first surfaced in eastern Asia around the year 547 bc in the Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great. Unconfirmed sightings of the Star have continued throughout history with the last report placing it in East Berlin, just before the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989.",
      "Unsurprisingly, the Seers of the Throne chase rumors about the Star with a fanatical intensity. Regardless of the powers the Star might possess, if the Star is truly the soul stone of an Exarch, the Seers might be able to use its inherit sympathetic qualities to communicate directly with their masters in the Supernal Realms.",
      "The Adamantine Arrow seeks the Star out of a sense of responsibility to the brave warrior who managed to wrestle it from Athichi’s grasp. Many senior members of the order also feel that the Star would best serve the Awakened by its destruction, or failing that, by hiding it away from the Seers forever.",
      "By spending one Mana and placing the Star (or the butt of a staff with the Star as its headpiece) in direct contact with the ground (or floor, indoors) the owner may create a temporary Demesne (equivalent in size to a one soul stone Demesne) as an instant action, with no roll necessary. When the Artifact is removed from the temporary Demesne, that area immediately returns to normal. The Star may also function as a Soul Jar for souls that have been removed from their bodies via the “Sever the Sleeping Soul” spell (see p. 141 of Mage: The Awakening), and unlike a normal Soul Jar, the Star can contain as many souls as its owner wishes.",
      "Once a soul has been stored in the Star, the Artifact may consume that soul to provide necromantic energy for a variety of effects. Each time the Star eats a soul, it shines with a sickly black light and radiates a feeling of indescribable loss. Consuming a soul is considered an instant action for the Star (not the owner), and the Star retains energy generated from devoured souls for a scene. The knowledge of most of the uses for energy generated by consumed souls has been lost, but the known uses are as follows. The Star may use the energy of a devoured soul to replenish five Mana to either its owner or to itself, heal its owner of five points of bashing damage, three points of lethal damage or one point of aggravated Health damage or add +3 dice bonus to any Death rote cast by its owner. Any of the above effects may be performed as a reflexive action, and effects are allowed to stack (a mage with, say, the energy from four souls in the Star could heal three aggravated wounds and restore five Mana to his pool).",
      "Study of the Star may lead to discovery of additional abilities, but there is a price to be paid for such knowledge. The Artifact, though powerful, is an inanimate thing that never devours a soul unless instructed to. Souls stored in the Star may, in fact, be released to return to their bodies. Instructing the Artifact to consume a soul is an act of hubris that requires a degeneration roll. Such callous use of a human soul will eventually drive all but the most evil individuals insane."
