            "These Rings get their name from the thin groove they have on the inside of the band, the so-called blood gutter. If even a few drops of blood touch the inside of the ring, capillary action draws it in and holds it there until it dries. The Ring can then be given to an allied mage, for whom it acts as an automatic Intimate connection for the purposes of sympathetic magic (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 114). This is not lightly done, as Blood Gutter Rings can be stolen and used against the blood donor just as easily. Some Awakened demand Blood Rings from those who swear fealty to them, others create these Rings against the will of the “blood donor” just by getting enough of their foe’s blood on their hands to fi ll the groove.",
            "Blood Rings can be used repeatedly to provide a link to a series of individuals, but the blood gutter must be carefully cleaned with a fi ne-bristled brush before a new subject’s blood can be put in. A mage can wear any number of Blood Rings, but a single ring can only contain blood from one person.",
            "Many Blood Rings are also imbued with other, complementary, magical effects that benefit from the Intimate connection provided by the Ring. Some Rings grant the ability to communicate  telepathically (as the Mind 3 “Telepathy” spell), others help the mage monitor the wearer’s location or health. Any spell that benefits from the Space Arcanum can be made easier through the use of one of these items."

The character must take the item to a Hallow, inscribe the rune for dreams on it in High Speech and then use the Prime 3 spell “Imbue Mana” to place one point of Mana in the item. Because of the special power of the rune and the Hallow, this spell can place this Mana in an item. However, the caster can only place a single point of Mana in the item, and the Mana is absorbed by the item, reinforcing its astral existence. As a result, the mage cannot use Prime 3 spell “Channel Mana” to recover this Mana for later use.",

Items destroyed in Astral Space not only remain intact in the Fallen World, but their astral versions are whole and undamaged the next time the owner enters Astral Space. If the mage wishes to give this item to someone else, the new owner must take the item to a Hallow and spend a one of Mana while touching the dream rune scribed on the object."

The gun can also be disassembled to carry in a case. If a mage has the capability to construct a functioning ceramic firearm replica from scratch, the Merit cost would drop by one; at the same time, such a replica would have a significant Resources cost to create. Even when the weapon is discovered, a mage may be able to convince airport security that it is a curiosity of some sort.",

When absolutely necessary, mages who can create invisible rifl es can also create invisible ammo through the same method. A case of invisible ammunition can be purchased as a one-dot Merit."

As a result, many STEADs have fallen into the hands of other Banisher cults, mages of all kinds and even a few clueless Sleepers.",

That Sleeper religion uses these devices in public demonstrations. Militant Auditing operatives camouflage themselves and even perform missionary home visits to uncover local mages.",
            "The STEAD’s base unit looks no different from the religion’s standard “energy meter.” It’s basically a device that measures electrical resistance in the human body. Sweat lowers electrical resistance, so the device can measure stress in a crude, unreliable fashion based on how sweaty the points of contact are. A STEAD connects the base to a small LCD monitor and a tiny box — actually a computer jury-rigged from PDA parts. When operated by a Militant Auditor, the monitor is visible to the Auditor and the subject. The device displays a flowing succession of abstract patterns.",
            "Atlantean runes and sigils are hidden within the shapes. Subjects can perceive the sigils and runes only subliminally — they flicker and shift too quickly and fuzzily for conscious recognition. If the subject associates Atlantean symbols with strong emotions, the STEAD detects it with enough precision to determine whether or not the subject is a Sleeper who’s experienced a strong emotional response to Atlantean symbols, a Pentacle mage or Seer of the Throne, a Banisher who’s witnessed Atlantean symbols or none of the above.",
            "The spell embedded within the STEAD combines Prime 1’s “Supernal Vision” with a superficial Mind 3 telepathic effect, modified due to the way Militant Auditors construct and use the device. It outputs false results if the subject responds to the images in an unexpected fashion. An order mage who despises Atlantean traditions may show as a Banisher; a Banisher who practices revived Timori traditions may register as an order mage, due to her lack of antipathy for the symbols.",
            "Militant Auditors prefer to examine subjects while both are seated in a calm environment. Subjects hold input leads in each hand. If necessary, a Militant Auditor can spend a point of the STEAD’s Mana to use it “psionically” at sensory range. This involves a small bout of active telepathy to broadcast the monitor pattern for recognition testing. It normally shows up as something the subject sees in the corner of her eye, like a floater or weird shadow. Either way, a STEAD’s targets can make a Wits + Composure roll at a –3 dice penalty; success indicates the subject recognizes the subliminal patterns, assuming she’s familiar with Atlantean iconography."

By recognizing the magical resonance of the individuals who have been established as legitimate users, the servers are able to reduce the likelihood of being activated or having their information “read” by unauthorized users, making Supernal Servers more resistant to hacking than unimbued computers. This protection works against mundane or Supernatural efforts to breech the server’s security or the security of its files, but does not provide any extra benefit to physical attacks to destroy the computer hardware itself.",

In this case, the Taser’s mundane capabilities have been combined with magic to produce a potent weapon. Tasers act like stun guns with the bonus of being able to attack your target from a distance (usually about 15 feet). A Taser uses compressed gas cartridges to fire a pair of metal contact probes attached to wires, connected to the gun. The probes become embedded in the body, instantly inflicting approximately 50,000 volts of electricity through the target’s nervous system. Just as stun guns, Tasers do not cause actual damage. The voltage that courses through a subject plays havoc with his body, causing intense pain and severe muscle contraction. The longer a Taser is allowed to conduct electricity to the target’s body, the worse the stun effect becomes. To attack with a Taser, a Dexterity + Firearms roll is made with any physical armor worn by the target subtracted. Even a single success allows for contact and sends electricity into the subject’s body. Every success gained on the roll counts as a –1 penalty toward the target’s next roll. If these successes exceed the target’s Size, he is knocked unconscious. The target can attempt to pull the Taser probes away from his body with a Strength + Brawl roll. Success allows him to escape the contact probes. If a target is knocked unconscious, the Taser ceases to have any mechanical effect on the target (the Taser continues to cause pain and contraction, but does not prolong the duration of the victim’s unconsciousness).",
            "In addition to the above effects, an Adamantine Taser reproduces the Death 4 spell “Enervation.” A successful attack with the Taser replaces the normal Brawling roll required for Enervation; during the  mage’s next turn, he can attempt to activate the item by rolling Gnosis + Death minus the target’s Stamina. Each success reduces the target’s Strength Attribute by 1 (maximum of –4 total). The mage may continue to jolt his target with electricity while activating the Adamantine Taser."

This second usage is especially useful in both foiling pursuit and keeping Sleepers from noticing that anything unusual has occurred. Using this amulet to walk through a door protected by alarm system within the door or the lock is completely safe.

            "This device allows the owner to summon archetypes from Astral Space. In form, this item always consists of three equal-sized rectangles of metal placed side by size and hinged so that they can fold flat or unfold in a fashion that allows them to form three walls of a small space. The metal panels are always engraved with complex abstract designs, and their edges are often elaborately carved or scalloped. These items are made by mages, but the details of their manufacture requires specific instruction by one of the few mages who understands how to create them, or temporary possession by an astral archetype of at least a Rank 4, who is willing to teach this process to the mage.",
            "After this teaching or possession, a Mage with Mind 4, Prime 3 and Spirit 2 can create this item. To use this item to summon a specific archetype, the user must decorate the altar with drawings, photographs or other images associated with that particular archetype. For example, if attempting to summon the teenage rebel, images of James Dean, young Marlin Brando and similar images would be useful. Depending upon the particular images and the archetype in question, these images provide an Acquainted, Known or possibly even an Intimate sympathetic connection with the archetype. The owner can then summon this archetype by spending one point of Mana and making a Gnosis + Mind 4 roll.",
            "In addition to summoning this archetype, the mage can use the altar to charge items that allow the archetype to possess individuals. To do this, the mage must roll to summon the archetype, after placing a necklace, bracelet, ring or some other ornament designed to encircle a portion of the wearer’s body in the center of the altar. Once she has successfully summoned the archetype, the mage spends one point of Mana to temporarily empower the piece of jewelry. The number of successes on the summoning roll indicates the length of time that the item remains charged. Use the advanced prolongation table for determining this Duration. Most mages inscribe the piece of jewelry with Atlantean runes to further increase this duration.",
            "Anytime during this Duration that someone puts on this piece of jewelry, the archetype may attempt to possess this person, and wearing the item adds +3 to any attempts by this archetype to possess this individual. This item does not force the archetype to attempt to possess this individual; the item merely gives the archetype a chance to do so. However, archetypes always refuse to possess individuals who are not in some way suitable to their archetypes’ nature. Characters who wish to make certain that the archetype possesses a specific individual must first make a deal with the archetype. However, many archetypes are eager to possess any suitable individual in the Fallen World and so require little or no persuasion to do so. "

The Box’s return to its owner is an extended action; roll Fate 4, with each roll representing an hour of time. The Storyteller determines how many successes are needed for the Box to find its way back; one success might be enough for a Box that’s been dropped in the woods to be kicked into the owner’s campsite by a curious fox looking for food; three or four successes might be required for a Box taken from a captured mage to be accidentally dropped in his cell by an absent-minded guard. Arrows who use this item stock it with different mission-specific items. A scout traversing harsh terrain may store medical supplies, emergency rations or fire-starting equipment inside; a warrior in enemy territory might load the Box with a spare knife or gun, extra ammo, lock-picking equipment in case of capture or a cell phone to call for backup.",

Using a Black Ribbon is one method used by the order to sever such onerous oaths.",

The mage then inscribes the basic idea of the oath, or the name of the person or group, the oath was sworn to on the Ribbon in silver ink (mages with knowledge of Atlantean Runes may instead inscribe the Ribbon with these mystic symbols). Once the preparation of a Black Ribbon is complete, the mage activates it by spending one Mana and cutting the Ribbon in half. This act simulates the Fate 4 spell “Sever Oaths” (see p. 158 of Mage: The Awakening). The mage rolls Gnosis + Fate (+1 if the mage used Atlantean Runes), and with a single success, the oath is ended.",

The mage can increase Target factors normally, by suffering dice penalties on the activation roll.

When this power is activated, the collar encircles the familiar (usually around the neck, if there is one) and tightens to infl ict its damage. If the familiar is a fetch, it will seem to be constricting empty air, unless the viewer is capable of seeing spirits.

A Phantasmic Lantern — or Phan-Lan, as some Arrows call it — is a small, handheld oil lantern that duplicates the Prime 3 spell “Phantasm” to weave solid illusions. To trigger the spell, the user must light the Lantern, expend one Mana and roll Gnosis plus Prime 3. Excess successes are added to a reflexive roll of Intelligence + an appropriate Skill (Crafts to create an object or Animal Ken to simulate a living thing, for example) to properly create the illusion. See the spell description for more detail. Illusory objects cannot exceed Size 5, and are fragile (Durability 1). But there are still many ways for a mage to make use of them. Phantasmic cloth could still shield one from sun or rain. A phantasm bush might provide concealment; phantasmic grass might disguise a snare or trap; a phantasm guard could delay an attack, or even prompt the enemy to redirect an attack to a different area.",

If the ring has more successes, the person is completely fooled. Because of the other Mind effects used by this item, viewers must subtract one die from all of their Composure + Gnosis rolls.

It repairs itself whenever it isn’t being driven as if the owner was casting the spell “Repair Object.” Interestingly, this process also destroys attempts to repaint or otherwise mark the surface of a vehicle and converts all license plates and ID stickers into unreadable rectangles of grime. This was more useful 50 years ago, before the rise of computer databases and stricter motor vehicle laws. Nowadays, it’s as likely to attract unwanted attention as avoid it.",
            "The Truck is remarkably, tough and agile for an old truck. Banisher drivers roll 9 again to control the vehicle. NonBanishers have a more difficult time; they don’t benefit from the 10 again rule, and every 1 rolled on the dice subtracts a success from their totals.",

It had once belonged to Hector of Troy but was refitted through the ages. At some point, holy men placed a tooth of St. Peter’s, blood from St. Basil, hair from St. Denis and part of the Virgin Mary’s veil in the hilt.",
            "Its name means “inflexible” as a testament to its supposed indestructibility. They say that Roland tried to break the sword as he lay dying but failed. And, over the years, as mages have tracked the sword that some claimed is Durandal, they’ve noted that it’s defied every attempt to destroy it. Tales say that Durandal’s made of the same metal that was used to forge Ogier the Dane’s Cortana and Charlemagne’s Joyeuse, but none have found credible, magical candidates that could be identified with these blades.",
            "Is this Durandal the genuine article? Mages doubt it. There’s no evidence for a historical Roland beyond a single obscure reference in an old Frankish record. The battles of the tales, where Roland and the other paladins fight bestial caricatures of Muslims, are about as historical as Arthurian myths — not very. But somewhere, someone created the sword, and it has become associated with the Roland legends. Interestingly, while Roland is almost certainly fictional, French mages do have records of a sorcerer with the shadow name Malagigi who was attached the Charlemagne’s court.",
            "The sword has a talent for falling into the hands of Banishers. Nobody knows whether this is a function of raw luck or magically altered destiny, but the fact is that Durandal’s washed itself in Awakened blood regularly over the 400 years that mages have been tracking the sword. The Mysterium and Adamantine Arrow have programs dedicated to capturing the sword, but it hasn’t resurfaced after vanishing in 1941, when the Nazis captured it along with dozens of other religious, artistic and occult objects.",
            "The sword’s blade looks as if it belongs to an unusually long Greek xiphos made of pattern-welded thaumium. This suggests the sword’s legendary heritage, but the sword’s composition and size are anachronistic. The sword’s furniture (its cruciform hilt, pommel and guard) look to be from the 12th century — the right date for the Chanson de Roland but wrong for the era that the hero is said to have lived. Nobody’s ever attempted to see if the relics of legend actually reside in the hilt. Untranslatable symbols that look vaguely like Greek Linear A have been roughly etched into the blade.",
            "Durandal is an enhanced, imbued thaumium sword. Its thaumium countermagic (see “Forge Thaumium” on pp. 203–204 of Mage: The Awakening) provides 12 dice of protection.",
            "As an Enhanced Item, Durandal is sharper than a steel counterpart. (This is figured in the listed game statistics.) Furthermore, the wielder can spend a point of the sword’s Mana to cast the spell “Pierce Magical Shield.” For unknown reasons, Durandal appears to be indestructible. Extremely powerful magic has so far failed to even nick the sword, but this may be due to the weapon’s ability to suppress magic."

Supernal Scourges are meant to punish mages who risk Paradox, but they also have a terrible affinity for mages from their home Realm.

            "• <b>Whispering Blade (Arcadia)</b>: This rapier’s blade is so thin that it barely makes a sound when swung, but it cuts like a razor. The metal shimmers like a fish through sunlit waters as the blade whispers through the air. In addition to inflicting aggravated damage to Acanthus mages, in the hands of an ignorant wielder (that is, someone who doesn’t know the High Speech phrase to speak upon drawing it), the blade bestows a –3 instead of a damage bonus.<br /><b>Durability:</b> 5, <b>Size:</b> 2, <b>Structure:</b> 7, <b>Damage:</b> 2L (2A against Acanthus or any mage on the turn following a Paradox).",
            "• <b>Oedipus’ Lash (Pandemonium)</b>: The Lash is a short, leather whip with the emblem of a bleeding eye burned into the wooden hilt. Those struck by the Lash feel not only the keen sting of the wounds, but also a profound sense of shame and fear. The wielder can spend a point of Mana upon successfully striking an opponent to render that opponent blind for three turns.<br /><b>Durability:</b> 4, <b>Size:</b> 2, <b>Structure:</b> 6, <b>Damage:</b> 1L (1A against Mastigos or any mage on the turn following a Paradox).",
            "• <b>The Forgeless Hammer (Stygia)</b>: This powerful Artifact resembles a simple blacksmith’s hammer with a wooden handle and an iron head. A mage armed with the Hammer can speak a curse before striking an inanimate object. Successes against that object in excess of the object’s Durability are then treated as aggravated damage against the object’s Structure, enabling the mage to destroy an object in short order (this effect is vulgar, however, and can engender Paradox).<br /><b>Durability:</b> 5, <b>Size:</b> 1, <b>Structure:</b> 6, <b>Damage:</b> 2B (2A against Moros or any mage on the turn following a Paradox).",
            "• <b>Lightbringer’s Sword (The Aether)</b>: This short, double-bladed sword is embossed with angelic script. A translation reveals a passage from the Gospel of Luke: “I saw Satan fall like lightning from the Heavens.” The wielder of this blade can raise it up (the player spends a point of Mana) to ignite the tip. While ignited, the sword inflicts an additional die of damage, and all damage from the sword is considered fire (which might be of note if the mage faces a vampire or another creature that takes special damage from flames). This effect is vulgar, of course, and can engender a Paradox.<br /><b>Durability:</b> 6, <b>Size:</b> 2, <b>Structure:</b> 8, <b>Damage:</b> 2L (2A against Obrimos or any mage on the turn following a Paradox).",

If the mage aims the stone at a patch of plant life — a bed of moss, a bush, a flowering tree and so on — he can change the plants into a swarm of insects or other base life (spiders, scorpions, horseflies and bees are all popular choices). This requires a point of Mana, and a quiet invocation to the spirit of the appropriate creature. This power is vulgar, and therefore can create a Paradox.<br /><b>Durability:</b> 2, <b>Size:</b> 1, <b>Structure:</b> 3, <b>Damage:</b> 1B (1A against Thyrsus or any mage on the turn following a Paradox)."

As long as he wears the item, the target is automatically affected by the Mind 4 spell “Telepathic Control,” under the control of the wearer of the other item. In addition, the target is also under the influence of a version of the Mind 2 spell “Emotional Urgings” that continually makes the target feel any actions she takes while under telepathic control are both reasonable and like her own decisions. In addition, the mage gains the ability to use the Mind 3 spell “Telepathy” to both observe the target’s thoughts and to receive all sensory impressions the target is receiving. Finally, the mage is also subject to a version of the Mind 3 spell “Multi-tasking” that allows her to act normally while simultaneously keeping track of the thoughts and actions of the target and controlling the target whenever desired.",
            "The mage can control the target, regardless of how far away the two of them are from one another. In addition, this control continues for as long as the mage and target both wear the item. Since almost all mages order the people they control to never remove the item, this control can be maintained for a very long time. Although this is difficult to create, it is relatively popular with powerful mages who are interested in working behind the scenes in mortal politics. Using this item, the mage can easily and discretely control someone for months or years."
