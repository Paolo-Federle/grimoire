            "In the arms race to harden information systems against intrusion, one system lags behind the others. The human mind remains the weak point in governments and corporations alike. And like any other information system, an attacker with physical access is more dangerous than any other. The so-called “rubber hose” method remains one of the most effective means of intrusion. Enter the Happy Place, an implant within the memory centers of the brain.",,
            "With only a few seconds thought, an individual possessing a Happy Place can electrochemically induce a sleep state and flood of intense, pleasant memories, rendering them virtually immune to intimidation and torture. Even better, since the process involves artificial tissue grafts, removing a Happy Place is more expensive than implanting one. A group of interrogators suddenly presented with a useless victim may opt to kill him... but at least he goes out happy.",
            "The Memetic Filter is a different technology with a similar purpose. Using a high-end expert system, the implant filters sensory data against a database of undesirable content. Think of it as SafeSearch for your eyeballs. The Filter not only protects against coercive input, but can be used to avoid contamination by enemy ideas. Originally marketed as a corporate security measure, it’s now a favorite among next generation zealots."

            "Majordomo is your friend. Majordomo is there when people fail you. He’ll even help you when your memory fails you. Majordomo keeps your personal information, schedule and entertainment for you. Digitally inserted into your immediate environment by high-end graphics and audio technology (the same ones used by the entertainment industry), Majordomo presents a character with fully configurable appearance and personality. Majordomo can be your personal secretary, your electronic boyfriend, or just your moral support. Majordomo: putting a friendly face on a confusing world.",
            "The Interlay represents a major and recent advance in technology. Human beings have long had the ability to connect biological systems to machines, but the Interlay goes a step further. Where Plugins like the Majordomo interface humans with computers by presenting information in a human-readable form, the Interlay goes the other direction, reprogramming human intuition to communicate with computers.",
            "A character’s Interlay uses her brain for what it’s already best at: pattern recognition. With an Interlay activated, the user can understand multiple data streams as easily as she picks voices out of a crowd or distinguishes objects in a room. With relatively simple training, she can also manipulate that data and feed it back into the system."

Just peel ‘em off and slap one on. The subject gets an invigorating mix of synthetic endorphins and electric shocks that’ll have him back on his feet in no time.",
            "Pep Pads were originally developed for military use, but they’re now available to the public. The Pads package a variety of quick resuscitation techniques into a single device. Essentially a smart bandage with an extra kick, the Pep Pad is standard equipment for fire and rescue crews as well as hit men and urban commandos."

The SQUID is a nearly autonomous automatic hacking device, introduced physically into a hostile situation with the aim of bringing down all information systems in the area. The goal is to deny hostiles use of their networks during a frontal assault, but private entities which have access to military SQUIDs often use them as the sole means of attack. Introducing a SQUID into a civilian system such as a hospital can cause chaos and death as effectively as an entire squad of armed agents.",
