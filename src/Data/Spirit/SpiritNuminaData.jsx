            "This Numen is unique to certain Supernal spirits hailing from the Primal Wild, though rumors exist of its possession by a handful of alien spirits from the unknown realms outside of the Tapestry. The spirit spends a point of Essence and rolls Power + Finesse as an instant action, with each success enabling the spirit to raise or lower the local Gauntlet strength by one, to a maximum of five or a minimum of zero. Note that a Gauntlet reduced to zero automatically creates a Verge (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 282). In the event that a spirit’s use of this Numen is contested (by another spirit with the same power, for example, or by a mage capable of influencing the Gauntlet), the party scoring fewer successes subtracts them from those of the party with more successes, and the Gauntlet strength adjusts by that many points in the winner’s desired direction, to the maximum amount allowed by the power used by the winner.",

Thus, the person still appears “broken” to the gremlin, which means that the gremlin cannot leave the person alone, and attempts more repairs . . . eventually, the person dies from shock or blood loss, and the gremlin sadly dismembers its “project,” keeping the best parts in its lair.",

If the gremlin is trying to fix a being or machine and has appropriate parts to do so (a wrecked car to fix another wrecked car, or a dead person to fix a dying one), the target number is five successes per point of Health or Structure that the target has suffered. Once the work is complete, the target bears the scars of being patched together from spare parts, but the spare parts work. A man sewn together after receiving new organs from his recently deceased friends might well wind up with a derangement or two, at the Storyteller’s discretion.",
            "On the other hand, if the gremlin is trying to fix a living being with parts from a machine or a different species, the target number is the number of Health points that the being has remaining that are not filled with aggravated damage. For instance, a man with Health 7 survives a car wreck, but suffers eight points of lethal damage in the process. He has six boxes that are not marked with aggravated damage (since one point “wrapped” and became aggravated), and so a gremlin trying to fix him with parts from his car needs six successes to do so. Once this target is reached, the victim is a horrid mishmash of organic parts and machinery (see below for an example). This unfortunate being lives only until the gremlin’s Materialize Numen expires (see below), and then the being dies."

Any qashmal with the Impart Numen has almost always been sent to Earth for the purpose of using that Numen.

This investiture gives a ghost a slight boost to its mental capacities, which allows it to better serve Yama without altering the core personality of the ghost. The second effect is more intrusive. Each time Yama creates a Judge, it exhausts all of its available Essence, pouring it into the wraith. In return, the Kerberos absorbs some of the ghost’s Essence, making Yama an anchor of sorts for the new Judge. This process allows Judges freedom from the Underworld and reshapes the ghost’s Corpus to the familiar form worn by all Judges. Used to deputize a visitor from the living world, Yama invests a single point of Essence into the character.

            "Many spirits favor subtle controls over their fleshy pawns, but some use this vile short-term method for greater control. With this Numen, the spirit can tap into the pleasure centers of a willing creature’s mind and soul, granting the creature’s ecstatic visions, immense pleasure and a sense of communion with the otherworld. In fact, this Numen is a low-level possession, a melding of ephemera and soul carefully steered by the spirit to elicit primal responses from the target. For one turn, the victim is completely incapacitated — perhaps babbling in the Spirit Tongue, dancing or even growling. For a number of hours after this effect (8 – Stamina), the victim feels charged and sure of her devotion to the spirit’s cause, receiving +2 on any roll when acting in accord with her ravisher’s desires. All other dice pools are at –2. Unfortunately, such intimate contact with an alien mind can cause damage to the target’s psyche. If the target fails a Resolve + Supernatural Tolerance roll, she gains a temporary derangement for a number of days equal to the spirit’s Power, or until she is no longer under the effect of this Numen, whichever is longer. The derangements that result are almost always ones that further bind the victim to spirit’s desires (fixations, compulsions, and so on.) Alternately, and depending upon circumstance, the Storyteller may rule that this act is effectively a Level 4 Sin. Furthermore, victims begin to build up a tolerance to the Numen, dropping the duration of the effect (halving the time for each rapture experienced in the same month). Each exposure to this Numen lowers the resistance to any of the spirit’s other powers, a cumulative –1, maximum –5; these penalties fade at a rate of one per day. This Numen costs two points of Essence and may only be used if the spirit is on this side of the Gauntlet and touching the target or with the Reaching Numen. ",

The other souls are then released, to go to their proper fates. If the spirit cannot complete its task of killing two more mages within a week after the first death, none of its victims are reborn. This Numen can only be used once upon a particular soul to rebirth its material body. Once this Numen has played out, the spirit is involuntarily subject to the effects of the Discorporation Numen.

These servitors cost time, and Essence to maintain; this is reflected by effectively lowering the maximums for the master spirit. Each spirit kept in fealty lowers the Willpower by one and lowers the maximum Essence of the commanding spirit by the total ranks of the spirits in its service.

A handful of especially potent goetic demons also know this Numen, as do some Fallen World spirits aligned to disparate vices (or the concept of vice as a whole). Whenever a character within sensory range of the spirit would regain Willpower through the indulgence of her Vice, the spirit may reflexively roll Power + Finesse, reflexively contested by the target’s Resolve + Gnosis. If the spirit succeeds, the character does not recover a point of Willpower (though she is treated as though she did, meaning that subsequent actions that resonate with her Vice will not yield a point of Willpower); instead, the spirit gains a point of Essence.",
