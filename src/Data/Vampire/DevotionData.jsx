            "This Discipline was developed in 1982 by Dr. Antoine Stockton. A Michigan physician who was Embraced by a Gangrel with a dying ghoul and more urgency than sense, Dr. Stockton became a Night Doctor. A recalibration of the undead body’s resistance to harm was a spectacular yield from his studies of Kindred physiology. He called it “Too Too Solid Flesh” because he was a scholar of the classics. The Carthians using it in the struggle tonight are generally less educated, more modern and inclined to call it 22 Solid.",
            "When 22 Solid is activated, it downgrades a number of lethal damage points into bashing. The damage reduced is equal to the user’s Resilience. Twenty-Two Solid can be used while standard Resilience is active, but 22 Solid lasts only for a single turn per use. This Devotion does not affect damage already taken, but only new damage inflicted while the Devotion is active. If the character has Armor, apply the Armor first before downgrading damage. If the Armor applies only to bashing damage, the Armor does not protect against damage that used to be lethal before it was changed into bashing by this Devotion.",

So say the Libitinarii, at least. A character with this power can remove the heart of another vampire and store it indefinitely. The subject maintains a supernatural connection to his heart through a bond forged with Auspex, however — a vampire’s fate is always tied to his heart.",
            "When the necessary number of successes have been achieved, the subject’s heart has been successfully removed and can be stored safely away from the rest of the Kindred’s body. A vampire whose heart has been removed is not subject to staking or diablerie, but immediately falls into torpor until the heart is set inside her body again. When the character’s heart is returned, she automatically awakens from torpor. In the event that another vampire attempts to diablerize the subject’s body, the subject merely suffers Final Death; the diablerist gains none of the benefits of diablerie and does not automatically lose Humanity for the attempt (though a degeneration roll is still likely). If the character’s heart is destroyed, she immediately suffers Final Death.",

Scrutinized individuals who are capable of any sort of magic (vampiric or otherwise) always glow with sparkling crackles of energy. Although this Devotion does identify sources of magic or items possessed of enchantments, it does not reveal magic effects in action (such as a magical fireball or an illusion).

The first vampire who notices one of the limbs — even if it’s only partially visible — will feel a strange, dreamlike attraction to it, and may find himself wandering over to have a closer look, even if he knows it might be a bad idea.",

Even those who are fearful or sense danger will be helpless to resist the lure — although they may be perfectly aware that trouble is lurking, and will be able to defend themselves normally if attacked.",

None of the phantoms conjured by this power will match exactly with any real person. The user of the power is aware of the kind of phantoms she has conjured, so she can play the scene accordingly.",

The targets will take bashing damage if they believe the phantoms have hit them, but after taking damage a target ceases to be affected by the power. Any target who sees a phantom fail to interact with a physical object, such as by being unable to pick up an object, also ceases to be affected. Those who break out of the power suddenly see things as they are, the phantoms vanishing utterly from their perceptions.

Since it’s very hard to get away from automobiles in an urban environment, Scratch has to make a lot of Resolve + Composure rolls. It does not matter how many times he succeeds. He is plagued by the fear until he loses control of himself two times.</i>",

Making the religious Solomon Birch averse to God might force a roll every time he sees a crucifix. The same aversion, inflicted on an atheist, might only trigger when he’s confronted with what he considers the indisputable presence of the Almighty.",

To the Telamones, these creatures are as common as the stone they crawl through, and this Devotion is as old as the Camarilla, so it is said. A Nosferatu’s weakness, normally, extends to even the animals he meets. With this Devotion, the Nosferatu weakness no longer applies to Animal Ken rolls and the Discipline of Animalism. So far, it is known only by the Telamones, who keep it a tight secret. It is with this Devotion that many Telamones, living in the tunnels, often keep cats, rats and other small animals by their sides to pass the time and somehow keep the loneliness of the Nosferatu condition at bay.

Most pet-keepers gravitate toward fairly mundane animals, usually dogs like Shepherds, Dobermans or Bull Terriers.

The blood cannot be used in the Embrace, doesn’t provide sustenance to vampires and, in general, can’t be used to create a Vinculum. However, Damned who know this Devotion can use the blood to create a ghoul.",
            "Ghouls created using the blood that results from this Devotion are different from ghouls created by the usual practice. Although the standard ghoul rules apply (see p. 166 of Vampire: The Requiem), the ghoul also goes through a few other changes.",
            "First, the ghoul becomes eerily attractive, much like a recently bathed Pretty, becoming almost genderless in his appearance. His skin turns smooth and pale like marble, his eyes grow ringed with gray and his limbs appear lithe and delicate. Thus, the ghoul suffers the standard Nosferatu weakness (dice pools based on Presence or Manipulation are exempt from the 10 again rule, and any 1’s that come up on the roll subtract from successes), but this social failing is due to alien splendor, not fearsome disposition.",
            "Second, this alien beauty has an effect on those around the ghoul. Those mortals near the ghoul (within 10 yards) suffer a –1 to all rolls involving Composure. These mortals are more likely to become easily frustrated and drawn to temper or, similarly, give into their lusts or other dark proclivities.",
            "The third and perhaps strangest effect is on the ghoul’s fertility. Most true servants of the Galloi are infertile — they are mutilated in a way that their reproductive organs do not function. These ghouls, however, are quite the opposite. Any time the ghoul engages in any sexual act that could end in reproduction, a pregnancy results. Every instance of sexual intimacy to climax results in pregnancy. Male ghouls impregnate every woman with whom they have sex, and female ghouls become pregnant from any instance of sexual intercourse. This is true even if either partner normally has nonfunctioning reproductive systems (from vasectomies, tied tubes or other biological conditions).",
            "If the ghoul goes a time (month or more) without the Galloi’s Vitae in his system, he reverts to being a “normal” mortal without any of the aforementioned modifications. If the ghoul is a female and was with child, the fetus dies in a bloody miscarriage.",
            "Note that this Devotion is required only for the first drink that creates the ghoul (that is, the one coupled with an expenditure of Willpower). After that, the Galloi may keep up the ghoul’s persistent condition via the normal taste of Vitae without this Devotion.",

This Blush of Life, however, is all too fleeting and all too tantalizing to the Beast’s hungers. Even the pleasures it allows are only temporary, as the vampire must shortly rush to a restroom to vomit back the mortal food it has consumed. A quick flush of the Blood may allow a vampire to escape scrutiny from mortals, but he still faces difficulties if he wishes to spend the entire night in one’s company. The cost of a little Vitae is repeated over and over as the night goes on, and the Beast begins to bellow for more blood.",

These are physical movements mortals perform unconsciously but notice just as unconsciously when others fail to perform them. A vampire using Night Life intuitively keeps his organs operating much as they would in an ordinary human being. The sensation is not entirely comfortable: Vitae, even warmed and liquefied, is no longer mortal blood, and the organs tend to grind in stops and starts. The vampire often finds himself experiencing alien sensations in and beneath his skin: pores opening one by one, intestines squeezing in fits and so on. However, a vampire who has mastered this Devotion also has the ability to avoid giving evidence of his discomfort and, indeed, gained some capacity to ignore it. Thanks to his air of Majesty, his mortal companions will usually forgive any tiny aberrations in his behavior, or unusual symptoms – such as clotted Vitae clogging an obvious vein or a light sheen of the Blood trickling forth with sweat.",

Night Life isn’t as pleasant as the Blush of Life, and it’s a long way from the blessings of true mortality, but it’s an efficient and reasonably comfortable way to stay out all night under close observation without arousing suspicion.",

A sentence of Final Death was pronounced, and she was granted leave to speak some last words. She swore vengeance against all who had conspired against her, sealing her words with this Oath.

The damage is caused as the Kindred’s own blood forms into jagged shards and cuts its way out of the foresworn body. (A Kindred with insufficient, or no, Vitae remaining still takes the full damage, but cannot lose more Vitae than he has.) There is no resistance roll allowed, as the Kindred voluntarily took on the Oath. The subject of the Oath has no idea how many successes were rolled, and thus does not know how much damage he risks. If the activation roll fails, the Oath functions as a Blood-Tell Oath.",

Most famous is Richard of Walsingham, an English Ventrue who was served by no fewer than three other Kindred under such Oaths. Martin of Brest was his bodyguard, Sophie Delisle his Seneschal, and Katherine Cajas his agent. Richard was, for a time, thought of as one of the most powerful Princes in England, thought to four cities with the help of his servants. However, a coordinated attack by his enemies, striking against all of his servants at once, drove him into Final Death over a century ago.

Certainly, that room is no longer used for any purpose, and entrance is prohibited.",

The Oath can be sworn, however, even if one of the parties is misled as to the status or power of the other.",

            "Conversely, the vassal may, at any time, borrow the use of one of the lord’s Disciplines for a single scene, by expending one point of Willpower. The vassal gains full use of the Discipline at the lord’s score. The vassal may borrow more than one Discipline per scene, as long as he has the Willpower to spend. Only Disciplines with which both the lord and the vassal are trained — that is, in which they both have one or more dots — can be borrowed in this way.",
            "When the vassal uses a “Discipline of largesse” from his lord, the vassal uses only the lord’s dots in the borrowed Discipline in concert with his own Traits. Thus, a vassal who borrows his lord’s five dots in Majesty would activate the power of Sovereignty using the vassal’s Presence and Intimidation, plus the lord’s dots in Majesty. The vassal must pay the cost to activate any power, in addition to the Willpower he spent to tap into his lord’s power.",
            "While a Discipline power is borrowed, the lord can still use it, but that Discipline contributes no dice to any dice pool in which it is included. Thus, a lord with Majesty 5 could still use Sovereignty, but he would roll only Presence + Intimidation to activate it.",
            "The lord may, at any time and across any distance, issue a command to his vassal by spending a single Willpower point. The vassal is not supernaturally compelled to follow this instruction, however, unless the lord empowers it with other Majesty or Dominate effects. Such effects work through the mystical connection of the Oath as though both parties were looking in each other’s eyes.",
            "The ultimate dissuasion to abuse, however, is the final effect of the Oath. Any damage inflicted on one party to the Oath is echoed in the body of the other party. All wound penalties suffered by the vassal or lord are suffered by his counterpart as well. (A party with the Iron Stamina Merit can only protect himself from the pain of his own actual, physical injuries in this case — the supernatural cries of pain from a vassal without that Merit still hinder a lord with the Merit, for example.)",
            "In the event that either party is dealt his Final Death, the other suffers the equivalent of a –3 wound penalty for a number of nights equal to the destroyed vampire’s Blood Potency, plus one point of aggravated damage for every dot of Resolve the destroyed vampire had.",

Swearing the Oath is, unusually, more expensive for the lord, which means that few senior Kindred swear these Oaths lightly.",
            "Invictus Seneschals are often bound to their Princes by these Oaths, but as the Devotions supporting these Oaths are very specialized, this is far from universal. There are few Notaries who do not know at least one version, but even fewer who know more than two. In some domains, therefore, these Devotions are never used.",
            "To invoke this Oath, the vassal must drink one Vitae from the lord’s veins, with all the risks of Vinculum and blood addiction that entails. The vassal then spends one Willpower point to tap into the power of the Blood.",
            "For every success on the activation roll, the lord can grant the servant a one-dot bonus in a Skill or Discipline, up to a maximum of his own score in the Trait. These bonuses do not subtract from the lord’s score. The lord must have at least three dots in a Trait to be able to bequeath dots to a vassal. (As might be expected, Auspex and Majesty are commonly bestowed with this Devotion.) A vassal must have at least one dot in a Trait to receive the bonus.",

            "If the vassal or the lord breaks the Oath, the vassal loses access to dots in the granted Traits but regains his “suspended” Willpower dots. A vassal or lord can slowly erode the effects of this Oath by withdrawing or surrendering the Trait bonuses one dot at a time; each bonus dot cut from the bargain restores one “suspended” Willpower dot to the vassal.",

This damage strikes the sworn immediately upon waking the following night.",

If the Kindred abandons the Oath, the hand immediately blackens and crumbles to dust, and the Kindred suffers a number of points of aggravated damage equal to the number of Vitae he invested in the Oath. Abandoning an Oath requires a conscious decision to break the promise — planning to do nothing for 100 years would garner a lot of nightly damage, but none of that damage would be aggravated.",

Jungian Agonistes contend that sealing away the memories thus protects them from being subsumed into the archetypes the torpid vampire encounters during her exploration of the collective unconscious, while more mythological-minded Polemicists claim the barriers of the vampire’s subconscious protects the memories from being swept away by the waters of the river Lethe. The end result is the same. By agreeing to be the subject of this power, a vampire puts himself at the mercy of the Agoniste and of fate. While each covenant possess methods of protecting its torpid elders, many vampires only agree to undergo this ritual when safely interred in an Agoniste catacomb, where a Polemicist will be on hand to perform the second half of the ritual when the torpid Kindred awakes.",
            "Elders who have undergone the Palinode awaken from torpor in a daze (or, in some rare documented cases, become creatures crafted entirely from the torpor nightmares and the Fog of Ages, more Beast than man) until an Agoniste uses this power to draw the memories back from the subconscious and reassert them, at which point the negative mental effects of torpor fade away.",

They’ll lock eyes with someone across a crowded room and just feel a click as they become the mortal’s whole world. Obfuscate, meanwhile, is a Discipline that the Daeva can learn only through difficult practice. The benefits usually run counter to those of Majesty, offering concealment instead of adoration. Yet, when a vampire learns the Familiar Stranger, she becomes able to pose as anyone her victims know and expect.",

Over time, she fused her mastery of Obfuscate with her rudimentary (and, she believed, innate) capacity to Awe mortals. After many hungry and difficult years, she learned to be recognized as anyone... and then she learned to be recognized as herself, with the benefits of Majesty. From there, she was able to pass the effect on to photographs taken of her. Photographs that could spread her image and her Awe throughout mortal society, without her having to interact directly with her future victims.",

At Storyteller discretion, it may also activate when a target views an image painted, sculpted or drawn by an artist under the effects of the Picture Perfect Devotion. The first time a target encounters a Picture Perfect image, they are affected as if the vampire had used Awe upon them. Subsequent viewings of the same image do not create the same effect supernaturally, but the target is unlikely to change his overall opinion of the picture. Viewings of further Picture Perfect images in the same scene are affected by the initial Awe, but do not have a supernatural effect of their own. They may, however, have that effect when viewed in subsequent scenes.",

This occurs once per scene, up to the maximum number of Picture Perfect images that have affected the target.",

Characters present when the picture was taken, but who were not targets of the initial Awe effect, are unaffected by the image. The image may be altered and retain its effect, so long as it remains recognizably the vampire or someone who closely resembles her.

She is shaken by an overwhelming violent urge, but she is not truly given over to the Beast.",

If the quarry is able to obscure his Beast, such as with the Mask of Tranquility power (Obfuscate), the task becomes extended and contested (see the “Clash of Wills” sidebar in Vampire: The Requiem, p. 119). If the quarry ever achieves the most successes in a roll, the tracker loses the trail altogether. If the tracker gets the most successes with each roll, they count toward the total number needed to follow the trail to its end. If there’s ever a tie on any particular roll, the Storyteller may allow the tracker successive attempts at that stage (see the World of Darkness Rulebook, p. 132) to resume the trail, all compared to the same number of successes achieved in the tying roll made for the subject. So, if the tying roll involves four successes, five or more successes must be achieved for the tracker for him to ever pick up to the trail again.

            "Animals do not weather the Embrace. Sometimes, the spark simply fails to take: the vampire wastes his precious Vitae by pouring it down the throat of a dead beast. Other times, the animal’s body seems to reject it: as the potent blood stirs the creature to a second life, the body contorts, bones snap, and the skin tightens to the point that it ruptures. Any semblance of false life is temporary and gone in moments.",
            "But with this Devotion, some Savages have learned to mimic the vampiric condition in animals. The Gangrel kills the creature and drains its blood (though he needn’t swallow said blood if his body cannot absorb such base material). Then, as the animal’s life goes winking out, the Gangrel feeds it his own Vitae and performs the roll below. The creature gives into a reasonable facsimile of life; this is no Requiem, not really, but for all appearances it’s easy to assume that somehow the beast was given the Embrace and dragged into immortality.",
            "Whatever creature is granted counterfeit life awakens, but not hungry like those humans who receive the Embrace. The beast awakens mostly dead of any personality it had before (this is less concerning with a creature such as a falcon, but perhaps more disturbing when performed upon a once-loyal and favored hound), and even its appearance seems to be muted and dulled: the sheen goes off the coat, any colors in the feathers seem gray or worn, its eyes fail to twinkle with that spark of life. The animal isn’t a mindless automaton, not exactly. But it changes. It lessens, somehow. Almost as if hollow of mind and soul.",
            "The creature retains the normal set of stats attributed to it (some animal stats can be found on pp. 202-203, World of Darkness Rulebook), with one exception: successes gained on the roll to enliven the dead beast can be added to its Attributes at a rate of one for one. If the Gangrel’s player achieves four successes, he can add four new dots to the creature’s Attributes (though Attributes cannot be taken above 5 normally). Other traits may change as a result: Defense, Speed, Health, Initiative, Willpower, and so forth.",
            "The Savage is tied to this creature in ways he may not expect, hence why the devotion often refers to the beast as a “familiar.” The Savage has an easier time when using any of the effects of Animalism upon the creature, gaining a +2 bonus to any such roll. During the day while slumbering, the Savage also automatically rides along in the beast’s senses with no roll necessary, as if having performed Subsume the Lesser Spirit. (The creature is not subject to harm by the sun, so it may wander in the daytime – though it may prefer instead to sleep next to its master, as well. The vampire, however, does not need to check Humanity to “stay awake” during daylight as opposed to the systems present in Subsume the Lesser Spirit.)",
            "The animal may ignore bashing damage. Lethal and aggravated, however, cannot be healed. The beast cannot be destroyed via lethal damage, but its body can be made such that the wound penalties (up to -3) carry through as it accumulates aggravated damage: it drags a broken limb, its head hangs low with the skin stripped off, or its ribs show through tattered fur or feathers. Once the beast has suffered all accumulated aggravated damage, it finally perishes, turning to a pile of leathery skin and bone dust.",
            "The familiar needn’t feed on blood like a vampire, but the Savage creator must nourish the animal with a point of his own Vitae once per night. Failure to do so causes the creature to start to decay, suffering one point of lethal damage per night that passes without consuming its master’s precious fluids.",
            "This power costs 18 experience points to learn for all Savages except those with Status in the Circle of the Crone. In the Circle, Savages find this devotion to be more common, and thus the cost is reduced to 15 experience points. (24 for non-Grangrel)."
