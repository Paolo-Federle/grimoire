            "Although most look human, all the Kindred conceal within them a feral predator, a Beast that divides all others into only two categories: threat or prey. Some Kindred feel their affinity with the animals of the world, and their connection with their own animalistic nature to a greater degree than others. These Kindred often develop the Discipline of Animalism, which allows them to bond with the beasts — and the Beasts — around them. They can not only commune with lower creatures, but project their will upon them, forcing them to obey. As the Kindred gain power, some develop the ability to join with animals, or to influence the Beast lurking with their own souls or the souls of other vampires.",
            "Most Kindred are repellent to animals. Lesser creatures grow agitated in the presence of the undead and normally flee the scene (or, in some cases, attack the vampire in question). Kindred who possess Animalism are a very different story. Animals are often attracted to such Kindred, and their presence is soothing even to restless beasts.",
            "Other sentient, supernatural beings such as shapechangers who have animal form or who can assume animal form are not affected by Animalism. Their intelligence makes them the purview of the Dominate Discipline. Therefore, a Ventrue can try to ply his will on a werewolf — even a werewolf in wolf form — by using Dominate. Similarly, Animalism is useless on another vampire who assumes wolf or another bestial form. Animalism is of no avail to the vampire in regard to such intelligent beings.",
            "Note that any Animalism power that requires eye contact is made more difficult if the subject does not stand still or is not otherwise immobilized. If the animal in question moves about, the roll to initiate the relevant power suffers a -1 penalty in addition to all others listed."

            "The Kindred with this ability has learned to understand the lesser creatures that surround her, and to speak with them and make herself understood. It is the foundation upon which all other Animalism abilities are built, for without understanding there can be no obedience. The vampire must initiate eye contact with the animal in question; doing so forges a strong empathic bond between Kindred and beast, allowing communication. This contact is at least partially mental. The vampire may either whisper to the animal in her own language (or any language she knows), or she may hiss, bark, chirp or make whatever sounds the animal might use to express itself. (Some Kindred prefer the latter, feeling that it joins them more closely with the animal in question, though many others deride them for it and consider the practice vulgar.) The animal, in turn, might make some sort of noise while responding. It might be a growl, a low chirp or anything else. The precise nature of the sound is irrelevant, as the meaning is conveyed mostly via the empathic link. Most animals instinctively respond quietly when answering Feral Whispers, unless the situation is a tense or violent one. The Kindred must maintain either eye contact or a constant dialogue with the animal. If she fails to do so for even a single turn, the link is broken and she must reinitiate contact if she wishes to speak further.",
            "Because Feral Whispers requires initial eye contact, animals that cannot see cannot be affected. Additionally, the simpler or less intelligent the animal is, the more difficult it is to link with its Beast or its emotions. Mammals, raptors and certain large reptiles are relatively easy to communicate with; insects, invertebrates and most fish are very nearly impossible.",
            "Note that while Feral Whispers makes sure that the animal communicates with the vampire, it does not compel the creature to obey commands or perform tasks. Further, the nature of the information conveyed by the animal depends largely on its intelligence and awareness. A cat might be able to explain that a large number of humans scared it out of a nearby building, but it’s unlikely to understand questions such as, “Was one of them wearing a green baseball cap?” or to have any real concept of numbers."

That is, they do not automatically sense that they are being controlled, but they might subsequently wonder why they suddenly acted as they did. Wise Kindred, especially those familiar with Dominate, are likely to figure it out in the moment, and few vampires take kindly to being manipulated in such a fashion.

Similarly, Animalism is useless against another vampire who assumes wolf or another bestial form. Animalism is of no avail to the vampire in regard to such intelligent beings.",

The order must be clear and straightforward — freeze, jump, run, stop, fall, cough, blink and so forth. If the command is ambiguous or confusing, the subject might respond slowly or perform the task poorly. Further, commands are always interpreted (within reason) in the subject’s best interests. For example, if the victim stands on the edge of a roof and the character commands “Jump!” the victim might jump up and down, rather than leap off the roof. Of course, the victim would probably not leap off the roof even if the character could find a way to order it. Subjects of Command cannot be made to directly harm themselves, so an obviously suicidal order such as “Die!” is ineffective. “Sleep” and the like causes the subject to follow the order only if she does not believe herself to be in any mortal danger. A character seduced by a Kindred might sleep if so instructed, but one in the middle of a combat or interrogation certainly does not. In such situations, the character merely falls senseless, but only for a turn.",

            "A vampire with this power can literally delve into a subject’s mind, stealing or reshaping memories at whim. The power, as with all uses of Dominate, requires eye contact. The Forgetful Mind does not allow for telepathic contact. Instead, the vampire acts much like a hypnotist, asking direct questions to draw answers from the subject, and then describing in detail any new memories she wishes to impose on the victim. Simple alterations, such as blurring brief and recent memories, are easy enough (and very effective for eliminating evidence of feeding or other Masquerade breaches). More comprehensive alterations, up to and including a complete reconstruction of the victim’s past and even identity, are possible albeit substantially more difficult.",
            "The victim’s subconscious struggles to resist false memories implanted from without, so the degree to which the vampire details new memories has direct bearing on how fully the subject assimilates them. An incomplete or simplistic false memory shatters much more swiftly and easily than does one with more attention to detail. For instance, “You drove home after work and had a very bad evening” is not likely to hold up. Far more effective would be an account such as, “You left work late, due to a last-minute change ordered by the client. You still managed to get stuck in rush hour for an extra 25 minutes, and you were seriously frustrated by the time you pulled off the freeway. There weren’t even any good songs on the radio. Three blocks from home, a cop pulled you over for coasting through a stop sign. At least he only gave you a warning, but it was still just one more hassle. The frozen dinner you microwaved was awful, the TV movie starred some has been you didn’t like, and the news was depressing. You finally turned off the TV in disgust and went to bed.”",
            "Truly effective use of The Forgetful Mind, then, requires substantial finesse and patience, as well as the ability to carefully and thoroughly think things through ahead of time. It’s fairly simple to sift through a victim’s memories and strip out recent events without even knowing precisely what happened, but doing so leaves a gap in the memory that can lead to further problems. Most people aren’t comfortable realizing they’ve lost a few hours or a night’s worth of memories, and they’re likely to try to find out what happened. Even new memories that the character imposes rarely have the same strength as the originals, and they can be broken or at least contradicted through investigation. For instance, a victim might not recall that she was attacked by a vampire, but she might remember being bitten, chalking it up to an animal attack or a spider. More vivid memories can return as snippets in dreams or be triggered by an unusual olfactory stimulus or spoken phrase. The process might take weeks or even years before the victim can begin to make sense of these flashes, but even the most effective memory manipulation is far from perfect — or truly permanent.",
            "A vampire may also use The Forgetful Mind to sense whether someone has had her memories altered in this fashion, and he can sometimes use his own power to draw forth and restore the original thoughts. No Kindred may use The Forgetful Mind to restore his own lost or altered memories, however."

If she is kept completely isolated from her master for eight weeks, the bonus drops to +3. Six more weeks, and it drops to +2, and so forth. The subject’s own personality and creativity slowly reawakens during this period, though she still experiences periods of listlessness, depression and desperation.

While retention of personality makes victims more useful in the long run, it also means they require more care in handling than targets of Dominate.

There is no limit on the distance or range of this power, but summoning someone halfway around the world takes time, even under the best of circumstances.

The subject does, however, use any resources at his disposal to see that he arrives both safely and punctually.",

Therefore, if a subject is truly far away or a sufficiently fast means of transportation is not available to him, he can deny the compulsion to attend the summoner at dawn. Indeed, he could return home and go about his business. If the subject is predisposed toward the summoner, however, he may continue the quest of his own accord. During the day, he is under his own power to find the vampire and loses his “direction sense.” Another vampire is not compelled to seek the summoner to the very light of day, causing his Final Death. The seeker finds shelter beforehand. Unless the subject already knows where and how to reach the summoning vampire, the call must be repeated each night until the subject arrives. If, as in the preceding case with the resistant subject, the distance is too far or available transportation is too slow, the subject might never arrive. He falls into a cycle of being drawn to and fleeing from the summoner.",

From hiding minute objects to the ability to appear as someone else to the power to fade from sight entirely, the Discipline of Obfuscate grants the Kindred uncanny powers of concealment, stealth and deception.",
            "Obfuscate clouds the mind in practice. For example, a character hiding an object by using this Discipline doesn’t actually make the object disappear, nor does someone using the Discipline to hide himself truly vanish. Rather, the mind sees “around” the Obfuscated object, refusing to acknowledge it, even if that requires a bit of filling in mental blanks. To continue the example, if a character Obfuscated a large sheet of plywood and tried to hide behind it herself, those looking at the plywood would, indeed, see the character lurking behind it but not see the plywood itself.",
            "The shroud of Obfuscate is very difficult to penetrate. Few Kindred or other supernatural creatures can see through it, and only under the rarest of circumstances do mortals have any hope. Because they operate on a less conscious and mostly instinctual level, however, animals often perceive a vampire’s presence — and react with appropriate fear or hostility — even if they cannot detect him with their normal senses. Similarly, children, the mentally ill and others who see the world in ways not quite normal might pierce the deception at the Storyteller’s discretion.",

            "It’s important to note that Obfuscate affects the viewer’s mind, rather than making any true physical change to the vampire. Thus, the Discipline is not effective at cloaking a character from mechanical devices. Photographs, video cameras and the like record the normal blurred image that all vampires leave in such media, not the assumed appearance. Obfuscate does affect any individual currently using the recording device, however, so someone videotaping an Obfuscated vampire sees the illusion when looking through the lens, discovering the truth only later when he reviews the tape itself.",

A vampire’s clothes and personal effects change shape with him, but he cannot normally transmute especially large objects or other creatures.",

            "Additionally, Resilience “downgrades” a number of aggravated damage points per scene equal to Resilience dots. This damage becomes lethal instead. Aggravated wounds suffered in excess of the character’s Resilience dots remain aggravated, however. This downgrade doesn’t apply to any aggravated wounds that the vampire already possesses, just to newly acquired ones suffered while Resilience is active.

            "Note that the extra Health dots a character gains in a scene while Resilience is active can have consequences later. If a vampire suffers more damage than he has his usual Health dots, those excess wounds upgrade existing wounds (bashing becomes lethal, lethal becomes aggravated) as per the damage rules on p. 171-172 of the World of Darkness Rulebook. In other words, once the character’s Resilience “powers down” at the end of the scene and the extra Health dots that the power confers are lost, he might have to contend with more serious wounds than initially harmed him unless he heals them while Resilience is still active. See the “Temporary Health Dots” sidebar on p. 173 of the World of Darkness Rulebook to see what happens when extra Health is lost.",
            "Also, if a character suffers damage that upgrades her Health chart, Resilience does not downgrade it. For example, if a character with seven Health dots and a single dot of Resilience suffers nine points of lethal damage, that ninth point stays aggravated. The other eight points are recorded normally as lethal (seven for the Health dots plus one for the Resilience), but the ninth stays aggravated as it upgrades the leftmost box on the character’s Health chart. If that’s all the damage the character suffers by the end of the scene, another of those points of lethal damage upgrades to an aggravated wound once Resilience ceases and the character’s Health dots drop to seven again. Kindred with Resilience are advised to be wise in combat, though they might feel invulnerable while invoking the Discipline."

Through the Coils of the Dragon, this covenant strives to cheat the curse levied upon its founder, stripping away the limitations and requirements of undeath until members achieve purity.",

Members of the covenant can study any or all of the coils, but they recognize that no vampire has ever truly achieved mastery — at least, not to the order’s knowledge. A character must have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Ordo Dracul) in order to learn any Coils of the Dragon. A player who takes at least one dot worth of that Merit at character creation may spend one of his character’s three Discipline dots on the Coils of the Dragon if he wishes. Any time a player wants to increase his character’s Coils of the Dragon score, the character must still have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Ordo Dracul) to do so.",

            "New dots of the Coils of the Dragon are purchased like a Discipline, with the number of tiers the character already commands serving as the current level and the “new level” being the next to be achieved. For example, a character knows five tiers of the Coils of the Dragon. For him to learn a sixth, his player has to spend 42 experience points (6 [the new level in the coil] times 7 [the experience-point multiplier for out-of-clan Disciplines]). Tiers must be learned in order in each coil, though a character need not advance one coil to completion before he can advance another. That is, a character with two tiers of Coil of Blood could learn the first tier of Coil of the Beast without learning the third tier of Coil of Blood. Because the Coils of the Dragon do not constitute a true Discipline, they are not limited by Blood Potency trait maximums. A character need not have a Blood Potency of 6 to learn six different tiers of coils, for example. Yet, increasingly more dots in a coil are always bought as if they’re out-of-clan Disciplines."

            "Theban Sorcery is the miraculous magic practiced by members of the Lancea Sanctum. According to the covenant, it is a tradition of magic taught (or stolen, depending on to whom one listens) by an “avatar of God.” The practice is said to have been received when early members visited Thebias in northern Egypt with a contingent of Christian soldiers during the reign of Diocletian, after Longinus had vanished from the world. The Discipline has decidedly judgmental overtones, combining a focus on Biblical elements (rains of blood, plagues of locusts, the vengeance of God) with a very overt and occult reliance on righteousness.",
            "Theban Sorcery is as jealously guarded as anti-Sanctified factions widely believe, if not more so. While few Lancea Sanctum hit squads lurk in the shadows to whack non-Sanctified vampires who seem to be able to use the Discipline, few covenant members want to see their divinely inspired powers taken for granted. The Lancea Sanctum isn’t foolish. It makes its mystical knowledge available “on loan” if the covenant has something to gain.",
            "Vampires who leave the Lancea Sanctum for other covenants invariably take their knowledge with them, but find it all but impossible to increase it. A character must have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Lancea Sanctum) in order to learn Theban Sorcery. A players who takes at least one dot worth of that Merit at character creation may spend one of his character’s three Discipline dots on Theban Sorcery if he wishes. Any time a player wants to increase his character’s Theban Sorcery score, the vampire must still have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Lancea Sanctum) to do so.",
            "<b>Cost:</b> Uses of Theban Sorcery always cost one Willpower point. Willpower is critical to use of the Discipline. It invokes the soul of the Kindred who performs a ritual. Willpower spent in this manner does not add three dice to activation rolls. Indeed, because one may spend only one Willpower point per turn, a Willpower point may never be spent to augment Theban Sorcery rolls unless specified otherwise. Willpower merely makes the magic possible.",
            "Additionally, Theban Sorcery rituals require certain items to be used or consumed to activate the powers. These components are known as offerings. Practitioners believe these items are offered in sacrifice to God, Longinus or to whomever provides the actual manifestation of the power. Attempts to invoke Theban Sorcery without suitable offerings fail outright. Offerings are consumed upon the invocation of a ritual, leaving behind nothing but a handful of ash.",
            "Like Crúac, Theban Sorcery does not have the same linear progression that other Disciplines do. A character’s mastery dictates the highest level of rituals that he may learn. Rituals are bought with experience points. For example, a character with two dots of Theban Sorcery can know an unlimited number of level-one and level-two rituals (provided the experience points are paid to learn each), but he may not learn any level-three Theban Sorcery rituals until his base Theban Sorcery dots are increased to 3. Each time a character acquires a dot of Theban Sorcery (including at character creation), he gains a ritual of that level at no additional cost. More rituals may be acquired with experience points. Other Vampire books offer Theban Sorcery rituals, and players and Storytellers are encouraged to create their own using those presented here as models.",
            "<b>Dice Pool:</b> Intelligence + Academics + Theban Sorcery. Unlike Crúac and its relationship to the Nosferatu, the Gangrel clan weakness does apply to the Discipline user’s roll on attempts to invoke Theban Sorcery rituals.",
            "<b>Action:</b> Extended. The number of successes required to activate a ritual is equal to the level of the ritual (so a level-three ritual requires three successes to enact). Each roll represents one turn of ritual casting. Note also that each point of damage incurred in a turn is a penalty to the next casting roll made for the character, in addition to any wound penalties suffered.",
            "If a character fails to complete the ritual in time (such as by being sent into torpor before accumulating enough successes) or decides to cancel the ritual before garnering enough successes to activate it, the effect simply fails. Any Willpower expenditures made are not recovered, however, and offerings are still burned to ash.",
            "<b>Dramatic Failure:</b> The ritual fails spectacularly, inflicting some aspect of itself as a detrimental effect upon the caster. A ritual intended to damage a subject inflicts its damage upon the caster, for example, while a ritual designed to store Vitae in an object depletes the caster of some amount of his own.",

Any object can contain the Vitae, regardless of its size, though the item must be at least the size of a person’s fist. The Vitae remains indefinitely until consumed. The act of consuming the blood might involve taking it to one’s lips, or holding the item tight and willing the blood to pass from object to body.

The exact dice pools of such efforts must depend on the style and purpose of each particular vision but are always based on the caster’s traits since the vision comes from the caster’s memory or imagination.

This ritual simply allows the sorcerer to successfully awaken any time during the following day, without planning in advance what criterion might be necessary to rouse her. A minor degree of clairvoyance is involved in this magic, as the character may even be roused by stimuli seemingly too distant to hear or feel — in short, the sorcerer automatically awakens when her sleep is disturbed. She may even awaken based on information that would normally be unavailable to a sleeping vampire, such as the time of day, the delivery of a package or the falling of snow. The range of this vague clairvoyance is extremely limited; the sorcerer is not made aware of anything outside the boundaries of the building or immediate region where she sleeps, but the specific limits are up to the Storyteller’s assessment of the circumstance. As a guideline, assume the sorcerer senses anything she could if she were awake and walking circles around her sleeping body. For example, the sorcerer may sense a car door slamming outside her haven, but not a car just driving by. She may become aware of rain clattering on the roof, but not of an approaching storm. She may dream that she’s sitting by a campfire on the dirt above her slumbering corpse when she sees eyes shining at the edge of the firelight, but be unable to discern anything going on out in the darkness.

The sorcerer selects a secluded location where he wants his prey to come, such as a cloistered garden or forgotten side yard, and plants there a thorny bush or tree, which is the offering for this ritual. The tree calls out to mortal minds with memories of hope and sensations of faith and awe. This song reaches out through homes and down streets, stretching as many blocks as the sorcerer has dots in Theban Sorcery.",
            "The Song of the Prey affects wandering minds, steering folks on idle walks and vagrants with nowhere to go toward the tree with an indefinable sensation. A subject simply approaches the tree as a troubled soul approaches an open church in the middle of the night. Once in the vicinity of the tree, a subject sits down and wonders, dreams or explores old memories. While she does, she is entranced and the vampire may feed. When dawn comes, the subject is surprised to find that she’s spent the whole night thinking, dreaming or perhaps praying, and hurries off without any knowledge that she’s been attacked.",
            "In the abstract, Song of the Prey can be used to guarantee tidy, quiet hunting. Each success earned on the activation roll yields the sorcerer one Vitae. This interpretation of the ritual is suited for use during in-between times of a story, and can be assumed to be a night’s work — while the sorcerer is doing other things, prey is coming and waiting for him at the tree he planted.",

The total number of mortals drawn over the course of four hours is equal to half the number of successes scored on the activation roll. When dealing with specific, established characters this ritual can be resisted with a contested action, pitting the sorcerer’s Intelligence + Academics + Theban Sorcery against a mortal’s Resolve + Composure. Mortals who resist the Song of the Prey are not steered by the ritual and do not approach the tree, though they may nonetheless dream of it. A player’s character entranced by the tree automatically awakens if attacked or otherwise surprised, but not if subjected to the Kiss with finesse. Characters may attempt to resist the Kiss as usual, but are assumed not to be surprised by it.",

This much-revered ritual draws forth thick clouds to blot out the sun and render the daylight a soulless, monotone gray. These conditions allow vampires to move about beneath the sun with minor pain and superficial burns rather than enflamed flesh and hair. The ritual reduces the intensity of the daystar’s rays to that of “faint, filtered sunlight” (see Vampire: The Requiem, p. 173), and reduces the damage to vampires within the area of power. Kindred beneath the unholy canopy of clouds suffer lethal damage every minute, rather than aggravated damage every turn. In the event of an exceptional success, the sky darkens to such a grim depth that vampires suffer just two points of bashing damage per minute.",

For each roll the sorcerer made to complete the ritual, the sky spends an hour thickening with smoke-like clouds. Note that rolls to complete the ritual are still made every turn — the clouds gather over one or more hours after the ritual has finally been completed. The clouds persist for 20 minutes per success scored on the ritual’s activation roll, then swiftly, strangely drift apart. Incidental rain may accompany the clouds of Damned’s Day, but such circumstances are not up to the sorcerer.",

Each of them makes a reflexive Resolve + Stamina roll to contest the miraculous fires.

The equipment in a desecrated room is most likely ruined, as well, negating any bonuses typically granted by the space or the things kept within (the equipment in a ruined doctor’s office is no longer a benefit to Medicine actions, for example).",
            "The space also resonates with a Vice, as though the building were a character of its own. The sorcerer’s player may choose any Vice to distill into the subject space. As long as a creature (mundane or supernatural) occupies the space, it is treated as if it had two defining Vices: its own and the space’s. Thus a drug addict (whose Vice is Gluttony) who uses a space cursed with the Vice of Lust as a den of prostitution may regain a point of Willpower for her actions, even though she is not normally a lustful person. If she were driven to prostitution to pay for her drug addiction she could regain two Willpower, one for each Vice.",
            "The Vice of the cursed site is insidious. It seeps into the minds and hearts of susceptible creatures who dwell too long within the place’s resonance of sin. How long constitutes “too long” is up to the Storyteller, but may be defined as a period equal to the character’s Morality or Humanity multiplied by ten minutes for first-time visitors. (Over time, the necessary exposure may expand into multiples of hours for frequent visitors.) For every such period a character inhabits the cursed space she must make a reflexive roll to resist undertaking actions that would earn her Willpower based on the place’s Vice. This roll is a contested action, pitting the visitor’s Resolve + Composure against a dice pool equal to the successes on the ritual’s activation roll. If the character succeeds, she feels an impulse (to drink, to fight, etc.) but isn’t carried away by it. If she fails, she attempts some sinful action appropriate to her own Morality or Humanity — perhaps, “feeling spontaneous,” she decides to trash the space or pick a fight.",
            "The power of the place doesn’t instantly make her into a monster, but it does lower her normal boundaries so that, for example, a prideful argument might lead to violence or a night of drinking might lead to infidelity. As a guideline, assume that the character undertakes an action that she’ll regret and will probably, but not necessarily, provoke a degeneration roll (let individual circumstances guide such decisions). If the character cannot indulge in the place’s Vice when she falls victim to it, she goes where she can (to a bar, to her home, etc.) as soon as she is reasonably able (possibly skipping appointments or missing work). Think of it as the character taking some of the Vice with her when she leaves — she might not rush out in search of drugs, but the Vice hangs over her until she acts on it.",
            "A character influenced by a cursed space retains the extra Vice until she has regained one Willpower point by acting in a manner consistent with that Vice. Once a character has won Willpower from the extra Vice, she is free of it unless she returns to a space affected by this ritual.",

As the offering crumbles to ash the building rots as though fourteen years of rainstorms, rats and ransacking had taken their toll. The sorcerer infuses the building with the Vice of Gluttony.</i>",
            "<i>Over the next several months, neighborhood kids venture into the church on weekends to explore and wreak havoc. Before long, it is a popular site for drinking and drugs. Secretly, local Sanctified use it for brutal feeding frenzies in which human victims are utterly consumed by new converts (who feel stronger and more confident with the satisfaction of recovered Willpower).</i>",
            "<i>Eventually, realtors come out to the church to see if it can be converted into luxury condos. They poke around the place for an hour or so, taking measurements and photographs. One realtor, failing his Resolve + Composure roll (against the building’s dice pool of 7), says “You know, we haven’t really gone partying for a while. What do you say we go out tonight and get fucked up?” By midnight, he’s convinced his colleagues to go with him out to an underground club and by three in the morning he’s passed out from drugs and beer and under the fangs of a hungry vampire.</i>",

For more on fire damage, see p. 172. If the sorcerer has some personal object of the subject’s, he may invoke this ritual from anywhere in the world. Otherwise, the vampire must be able to see his subject. The object must be of some importance to the intended victim — a picture of his dead wife works, while his car keys or cell phone might not.

        "Name": "Crúac",
        "LongDescription": [
            "Crúac is the common name for the pagan blood sorcery practiced by the Circle of the Crone. A type of ritual magic, Crúac, meaning “crescent,” is a mixture of pre-Christian and pagan magic from across the globe whose only common element is a reliance on blood sacrifice. Crúac is denounced by many traditional Kindred as “black magic” or “witchcraft,” and in areas where the Lancea Sanctum holds sway, Crúac’s known practitioners are occasionally persecuted as heretics. Of course, it is such very derision and fear of Crúac that leads many to the Circle of the Crone and, by extension, to this Discipline’s study. The Circle of the Crone’s message of empowerment speaks to many a neonate, and for some there is no greater expression of that empowerment than this Discipline.",
            "Crúac is one of the central mysteries of the Circle of the Crone’s belief structure, as well as a potent weapon in the covenant’s arsenal. As might be expected, knowledge of the Discipline is a closely guarded secret. New initiates are not usually trusted with its secrets. As a new member in a quasi-religious Kindred faction, a vampire might well have to prove his loyalty to the Circle through tests and ordeals before its adherents are willing to share their knowledge. Though vampires who leave the Circle of the Crone for other covenants invariably take their knowledge with them, many find it all but impossible to increase their knowledge of Crúac outside the Circle’s structure. A character must have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Circle of the Crone) in order to learn Crúac. A player who buys at least one dot worth of that Merit at character creation may spend one of his character’s three Discipline dots on Crúac if he wishes. Any time a player wants to increase his character’s Crúac score, the character must still have at least one dot of Covenant Status (Circle of the Crone) to do so.",
            "Because of myriad cultural differences within the Circle of the Crone, many rituals exist that approximate the following ones in effect if not in name. Thus, the level-one ritual Pangs of Proserpina may be known as the Appetite of Limba in New Orleans or the Curse of Tawrich in Tehran. Other Vampire books offer new Crúac rituals, and players and Storytellers are encouraged to create their own using those presented here as models.",
            "<b>Cost:</b> Uses of Crúac always cost at least one Vitae. Unless the text for a specific power (known as a ritual) specifies otherwise, assume that the cost is one Vitae. Vitae plays a very important role in the use of Crúac — it literally calls upon the power inherent in the Blood to fuel supernatural effects. Use of Crúac requires that the Vitae be “spent” in a visible or otherwise significant manner. For example, when a Vitae is spent for a character to activate a ritual, he likely has to cut himself with a dagger and bleed on the ground, activating the magic with the spilled Vitae (or through some other direct appeal to the power of the Blood).",
            "Crúac does not have the same linear progression that other Disciplines do. A character’s mastery dictates the highest level of rituals that he may learn. Rituals are bought with experience points. For example, a character with two dots of Crúac can know an unlimited number of level-one and level-two rituals (provided the experience points to learn each of them are paid). He may not learn any level-three Crúac rituals until his Crúac dots increase to 3. Each time a character acquires a dot of Crúac (including at character creation), he gains a ritual of that level at no additional cost.",
            "Crúac is insidious. It demands a certain degree of subservience and even cruelty from its practitioners, possibly in deference to the dire old gods from whence the Discipline is rumored to come. For some power-hungry sorcerers, Crúac indulges the will instead of enlightened use of the Discipline. A character’s dots in this Discipline, subtracted from 10, is the maximum to which his Humanity may rise. For example, the Gangrel Roland Gentry possesses Crúac at level three. His maximum Humanity is therefore 7. If a character increases his Crúac score higher than his Humanity would normally allow, his Humanity immediately drops to the appropriate level and the player makes a Humanity roll to see if the character acquires a derangement in the process of heightening his occult knowledge. (See pp. 182-188 for more on Humanity rolls and derangements.)",
            "<b>Dice Pool:</b> Manipulation + Occult + Crúac. Because of its sanguinary nature, Crúac doubles any bonuses that a vampire’s blood ties might apply, such as in a ritual performed on a sire, grandsire, childe or grandchilde. Also, the Nosferatu clan weakness does not apply to the Discipline user’s roll.",
            "<b>Action:</b> Extended. The number of successes required to activate a ritual is equal to the level of the ritual (so a level-three ritual requires three successes to enact). Each roll represents one turn of ritual casting. Note also that each point of damage suffered in a turn is a penalty to the next casting roll made for the character, in addition to any wound penalties that a caster might suffer.",
            "Costs to activate Crúac rituals must be paid before the roll can be made. Normally this isn’t an issue, as a ritual that costs one Vitae can have its activation roll made in the same turn (as spending Vitae is a reflexive action). In some cases, though, a ritual costs more Vitae than the caster can spend in a single turn. In cases like these, the caster’s player makes the roll on the turn he (reflexively) spends the last Vitae necessary to invoke the ritual.",
            "If a character fails to complete the ritual in time (such as by being killed before accumulating enough successes) or decides to cancel the ritual before garnering enough successes to activate it, the effect simply fails. Any Vitae expenditures made are not recovered, however.",
            "<b>Dramatic Failure:</b> The ritual fails spectacularly, inflicting some aspect of itself as a detrimental effect upon the caster. A ritual intended to damage a subject inflicts its damage upon the caster, for example, while a ritual designed to plague its victim with pangs of hunger visits its effects upon the caster.",
            "<b>Failure:</b> The ritual fails entirely, but not dangerously. Vitae is consumed as normal, but the ritual has no effect.",
            "<b>Success:</b> The ritual takes place as described.",
            "<b>Exceptional Success:</b> The ritual takes place as described. In many cases, extra successes are their own reward, causing additional damage or conferring extra duration, capacity or similar benefits.",

The performer must spend the standard one Vitae to complete the ritual, plus another Vitae (or possibly more) to bear witness at the site to be watched. The Vitae left behind must come from the performer, whether it’s vomited up, spilled from the wrists or via some other means. The blood may be dribbled on a floor, soaked into a rug, painted onto a wall or otherwise applied as the performer sees fit. However the blood is left behind, it remains as detectable as any ordinary blood. If it’s scrubbed away, the power of this ritual is broken.",
            "For one full night per Vitae spent, the character invoking the ritual gains the ability to witness events at the location as though she were present and standing in whatever spot she had marked with her Vitae. If the character creates a trail of blood around a room, for example, she may later observe the room from any point on that “circuit.” Because the seer isn’t actually present at the location, she may even observe events that occur during the day — the images come to her in an achingly vivid dream while she sleeps. Some Acolytes use this ritual just to gain a glimpse of their own gardens in the sunshine. Seers are still subject to the Rötschreck, however, as the Beast panics in the light of the sun. Observers who succumb to the fear frenzy do not actually lose control of themselves, but do lose their connection to the Vitae they’ve used in this ritual. While the seer is watching through her blood connection, she is unable to see or hear through her own body.",
            "The boundaries of this power are limited. Only one arcane connection can be employed by any single character at one time, even if multiple Vitae are spent on that connection. Multiple Vitae can be used to widen the area of observance, at one Vitae per room included. Vitae may be deposited in a vehicle, so the observer becomes a clairvoyant passenger. If the distance between the character and the Vitae exceeds 10 times the sorcerer’s Blood Potency in miles, the mystic connection breaks.",
            "The observer’s perception is limited through the mystical connection, but not by physical barriers the character can see around. If a rug is laid down over the blood she leaves behind, she sees as if she stood on that rug. If a door is closed between her Vitae and another room, she doesn’t gain any power to see through it, but may hear sounds that come through it. Her powers of perception depend on her supernatural prowess. The number of successes on the Crúac roll becomes the number of successes she scores on all attempted actions to perceive the world through her arcane connection (such as Wits + Composure or Wits + a certain Skill; see p. 46 of the World of Darkness rulebook for details). The testimony of the blood witness is affected by environmental impediments like darkness and smoke just as ordinary vision is affected. No other Disciplines may be used through the blood connection, so a character may not employ Heightened Senses, for example.",

With it, a character grows a unique species of red lily said to have been brought back from Hades by Persephone. The flower grows only in mortal blood — which must be supplied in total at the start of ritual — but is traditionally grown from a human corpse. To raise a Flower of Demeter, the sorcerer’s player must make a successful invocation roll once per week until the three successes necessary to satisfy the roll have been accumulated. (In this case, the extended action happens over the course of a week or weeks, not turns as is normally specified by Crúac rituals.) Over this time, the stalk of the plant grows slowly taller and taller from the ground or corpse that supplies its blood, up to a height of about six feet. Once the three successes have been garnered, the Vitae of the Acolyte brings the flowers to bloom. One bud on the stalk blooms per dot of the character’s Blood Potency, less one per week it took to cultivate the stalk, with a minimum of one.",
            "The plant itself is inspiring to Kindred in an intangible, mystical way for as long as at least a single blossom remains on its stalk. All Craft and Expression rolls made in the presence of the flower gain two extra dice. This inspirational power is said to be an echo of Demeter’s springtime joy.",
            "A vampire who swallows a Flower of Demeter experiences the blush of life until the next sunrise, with no expenditure of her own Vitae. She is capable of keeping down food, keeping up sexual activity and mimicking respiration and blood flow almost without thought. When the sunrise comes, however, the vampire undergoes an awful purge, vomiting up all food and drink consumed and experiencing tremendous but harmless anguish described by those who’ve experienced it as a “mourning of the flesh.”",
            "An Acolyte cannot raise a new Flower of Demeter until her current specimen has been fully deflowered or allowed to die. The plant suffers all the anathema of the Kindred, and is destroyed in seconds by fire or sunlight. Blossoms clipped from the plant lose all mystical properties at the next sunrise, when they flake away in sheets of ash like burnt paper."

All three sacrifices must be made during the same night, with the Acolyte making the roll and spending her own blood after the final bloodletting. No vampire, spirit or other supernatural creature may feed from the dead — doing so ruins the ritual.",
            "Once the region is marked out and the attempt succeeds, the Acolyte operates as a local patron spirit to that area for a number of nights equal to the total successes she rolled. The Storyteller may adjudicate just what it means to be patron in terms of minor effects, but the player also chooses a concrete manifestation of authority for the character. This effect can be different each time the character performs the ritual. Doing the ritual again while it’s already in effect does not allow a second manifestation but does extend the duration of the effect already in place.",
            "Players and Storytellers should work together to develop the effects of As One. Some examples include the following: ",
            "<ul><li>Eyes of the Wise. Whenever she meets a living person who resides within her territory, she learns one thing about him that she has no other way of knowing. This could be innocuous — “Her husband’s private nickname for her is ‘Lollipop,’” or that he sexually assaulted his eight-year-old cousin when he was 13 and they’ve never spoken about it to anyone, even though they see each other every Christmas.</li><li>Make Straight the Royal Highway. The Acolyte takes no penalties from mundane physical obstacles while on foot. Anything she could push through without physical harm, she can now pass through without impediment. Thus she can run full speed on ice without falling or pass through a crowd of slam-dancers without slowing down. She can walk through a downpour without getting wet and across dry leaves without making a sound. Furthermore, once per night she can defy one obstacle that would normally halt her: she can command a door to unlock or walk across the surface of a pond.</li><li>Immortal Viands. Instead of spending a point of Vitae to wake for the night, she can instead drain the vitality of her domain. This can’t be used for anything but waking, can only be used once per night and while the damage is subtle, definitely harms the location she rules. If she’s in a forest, the damage might strike dead one tall tree or invite a blight that threatens all of them. If she’s in a city, a building might catch fire, a business might fail or a malevolent ghost or spirit might suddenly wake up feeling right at home there.</li><li>The Very Stones Defend Me. Once per night, the Acolyte can have her land attack somebody. Both the Acolyte and the target of the attack have to be in her realm. The nature of the attack always seems to be an accident — anything from a car crash in the city to a falling branch in the woods to a lightning strike on the plains. The Storyteller decides if the damage would be bashing, lethal or aggravated. The pool for bashing damage is the ritualist’s Presence + Occult + Crúac. For lethal, the pool is Occult + Crúac. For aggravated, it’s equal to her Crúac rating only.</li><li>Cowan’s Mark. Once per night, the Acolyte can curse one person who does not routinely spend time in her region with the Nosferatu clan weakness. The cursed person seems untrustworthy, shifty — like a stranger.</li><li>The Trees Give Voice. Once per night, the Acolyte can gain information from her territory. This may take the form of a vision (quite similar to those garnered from The Spirit’s Touch, as described on p. 121 of Vampire: The Requiem), only the vision is specific to the information the character seeks. Alternately, she may call up minor spirits that reside in the area and interrogate them for what they know in a question-and-answer format. It should be noted that this power only works on physical events that happened in her terrain. This power cannot explain what someone there was feeling, only show what that person did.</li><li>Taste the Blood of the Spirit. Any time Disciplines or magic of any genuine sort are used in her territory, the ritualist knows it. If it’s a Discipline she herself possesses, she recognizes it and gets a vague sense of the direction where it was used. If it’s something different (a sorcerer’s spell taking effect or a werewolf changing shape) she knows something happened and has a vague idea of how powerful the effect, but she doesn’t know what or where.</li><li>Sanctuary. Once per night, she may declare an area of about a 20-foot radius as her sanctuary. No one outside that area can enter unless he wins a contested roll. The interloper rolls Resolve + Composure + Blood Potency. The ritualist rolls Presence + Occult + Crúac. Sanctuary lasts for one scene.</li></ul>",
            "On top of those effects, the Storyteller either rolls a die or secretly chooses one of the side effects listed below.",
            "<ul><li>Sketchy images of her face appear in stains, or arise momentarily from TV static or seem to form briefly in the patterns of rain rolling down a windshield.</li><li>Every time a radio is playing in her presence, it plays music appropriate to her mood or situation.</li><li>She seems very familiar to everyone in her territory, even if they know they’ve never met her before.</li><li>Small plants die and instantly wither when she steps on them.</li><li>All animals stare at her and fall silent in her presence. Unless compelled to do something else (a dog is told to heel or a car bears down on a cat in the street), the animals keep a wary distance and gaze at her intently.</li><li>People cannot catch their breath if her shadow is touching them. Prolonged exposure won’t kill someone, but he pants and feels an icy chill clutch his chest.</li><li>No one in her territory can speak her name.</li><li>Her mood affects the weather. If she’s sad, the sky is cloudy. If she’s enraged, there are sandstorms or hail. If she’s content, expect unseasonably pleasant skies. This cannot create rapid or unnatural changes, but it’s definitely perceptible.</li><li>Sensitive artists have to roll Resolve + Composure every night, or else suffer a nightmare about the Acolyte.</li><li>In her presence, shadows thicken, flames gutter and waver while light bulbs flicker and dim. All attempts to hide from sight get a +1 bonus, and all damage pools from fire get a -1 penalty. This effect happens anywhere she can be seen.</li></ul>"

            "Cattiveria is an Italian word meaning, quite simply, “wickedness.” Its development took generations of blood and sacrifice, such that it lives up to its name in both practice and spirit.

            "When Lodovico became a vampire, he found himself robbed of the sorcery that had allowed him to command corpses and spirits when he was alive. Infuriated by what seemed to be a calculated punishment, the fledgling Kindred threw himself once again into studying the texts and stories he had inherited from his mother, striving in a haze of madness to discover what manner of block had been imposed on his talents. He traveled to Florence, hearing of a gathering there of others of his kind, and there he encountered the Lancea Sanctum, at one of whose midnight masses Ludovico was at last stricken with the revelation he had sought.",
            "Lodovico’s epiphany related to the nature of the very force that traps a vampire in his undying state. Much as a vampire is able to impart power to a ghoul through his Blood, so, too, can that animating force be shared with a corpse, granting it a jerky, unwholesome animation. Its kinship with a substance spiritualists in a later age would call ‘Ectoplasm’ likewise makes it particularly useful for drawing ghostly manifestations into the world.",
            "In practice, Cattiveria is almost more of a scholarly pursuit than an occult discipline, its practitioners more like engineers than occultists, even though its workings universally demand the trappings of black magic — if only to cement in the Necromancer’s mind the grim reality of what he has set out to do. Almost no application of this discipline can be enacted on the fly, instead typically requiring candles to be lit and blood to be shed in addition to whatever bizarre trappings please the Necromancer’s sense of drama."

Once so inducted, the new blood priest can expect fear and reverence in equal measure from any other creature with a Beast, including his own covey-mates, and the sacred practice of Choronzon is one of the primary reasons why. With little measure of exaggeration, it can be truly said that the Brood itself would risk collapsing under its own weight without both the guidance of the Therion and the unique power of their Discipline. Without these, the Forsworn would be crippled by their own beliefs — rendered impotent (or worse) by the very Pursuit that drives them in all things.",

(Returning to the fold thereafter requires the rites be performed again.) If a covey member other than the Therion leaves the covey with two or fewer members, the Therion and the remaining member continue to gain the benefits of existing effects but cannot conduct new Choronzon rites until the third member has been replaced. If the Therion leaves the covenant or meets Final Death, the benefits of his rites end at once for all involved. Otherwise, the effects of each rite last for so long as the Crux binds its participants together.

As the systematic dissolution of Humanity is integral to the Forsworn, however, this power works to aid in that intentional descent. All participants in the rite gain some measure of protection from the usual risks that accompany Humanity loss. First, any time a participant commits a sin for which he must make a degeneration roll, that covey member may opt to use the Therion’s rating in the Choronzon Discipline (the current rating, not the rating at the time the rite was conducted) instead of the usual dice pool. Second, any time one who participated in the rite must roll for a derangement after losing Humanity, he or she adds the Therion’s rating in Choronzon as bonus dice to the Humanity roll (to a maximum of 10 dice).",

His Therion’s rating is •••, so he’d get an extra die in this case, but he decides he doesn’t want the help this time. He rolls just the two dice . . . and fails, falling from Humanity 4 to Humanity 3. Usually, he would now roll his new Humanity rating (three dice) to see if he gains a derangement, but since he was under the effects of this power at the time, he gets to add his Therion covey-mate’s Choronzon rating (•••) as bonus dice to the derangement roll, in this case doubling his chances of success.</i>"

This has the unfortunate side effect of putting the Forsworn out of commission for extremely long periods of time, while those outside his covenant rise much sooner after repairing even more grievous wounds to their undead flesh. The power of the Reconsolatio rite, however, works to even the scales some in this regard. The rite is known as “the cleansing” for the way it prepares the Forsworn soul for the rigors of torpor.",
            "Each dot of Choronzon adds 1 to each participating covey member’s Humanity rating for the purposes of determining time spent in torpor (see Vampire: The Requiem, p. 175), to a maximum equivalent rating of 10.",
            "A Brood member with Humanity 3, for example, would normally spend a base time of one decade in torpor (which is then multiplied by his Blood Potency to determine the total time spent in torpor). If he participated in the Reconsolatio as led by a Therion with Choronzon •••, however, he would be considered Humanity 6 with regards to torpor, and would thus reduce his base time spent in torpor to just two weeks, rather than 10 years."

Augustus activates his Constance — his Resolve increases to 8 and his Willpower dots increase to 10; even though he has seven dots in Willpower and four in Constance, Augustus’ Willpower cannot rise above 10. Augustus gains three more Willpower points, for a total of four. He spends one right away on a Wits + Empathy roll to discern the Archbishop’s mood and judges him to be tense and anxious.</i>",

The Bron embody this myth through their Discipline of Crochan, from the Welsh word for “cauldron,” which allows them to harness and manipulate the power of Vitae to regenerate their undead flesh. This Discipline is not without its dark side, though. Just as the Bron are Damned, Crochan is a cursed version of the Grail’s healing power that can both give life and take it away with equal facility.",
            "Crochan is essentially an enhancement of a vampire’s innate ability to heal wounds through the power of Vitae. Therefore, a Bron may not spend Vitae to heal wounds in the same turn he uses a Crochan power, even if his Blood Potency allows him to spend more than one Vitae per turn. This restriction applies only to the Crochan user; if he targets another Kindred with one of the powers of Crochan, that vampire may spend Vitae for healing in the same turn. Likewise, this Discipline affects only creatures who possess the ability to use Vitae to heal their wounds. Crochan does not affect other supernatural creatures’ powers of mystical healing, such as a werewolf’s natural regeneration. In most cases, this means that Kindred and ghouls are the only valid targets, but the World of Darkness is a vast and mysterious place, and strange creatures lurking in the shadows may well be capable of harnessing the power of the Blood.",
            "Despite the many drastic differences between the Sanctified Bron and the Acolyte Fisher Kings, Crochan is common to both branches of the bloodline, differing in minor, cosmetic applications only. The Sanctified often accompany the use of Crochan with fervent prayers and the laying on of hands, while the Acolytes prefer elaborate chants in Welsh or Manx Gaelic and savage bloodletting rituals. Many Bron Acolytes “sacrifice” the Vitae required to power this Discipline by slicing their wrists, breast or even throat, and letting the blood spill onto the ground. (Mechanically, this is no different than spending a Vitae by simple act of will; the Bron suffers no additional damage or blood loss, and the time required to activate the Discipline does not increase.)",
            "Crochan is notably less common among the rare few Invictus and Carthian Bron. Some Invictus find the very idea of playing with the power of the Blood to be foolishness worthy of an especially reckless Dragon, while some Kindred of the Carthian Movement view Crochan’s ability to manipulate the Vitae of others to be a gross violation of another Kindred’s personal rights. The Dragons, for their part, note the similarities between Crochan and the philosophy behind the Coils of the Dragon, and ponder over many troubling questions in their unbeating hearts."

The Beast rages against its own destruction, or maybe the vampires’ supernatural natures help them resist Despond. Mortals succumb all too easily to the lure of self-annihilation.",

To set the lure of self-destruction, they must feel that lure themselves. Many among the Children of Judas — perhaps most — already walked that path as mortals, to its terrible ending. Other Kindred seldom want to touch the void, and be touched in return. Those who can resist the call of oblivion learn to make that call themselves.",

Despond has no effect over the phone or through a recording.",

He might even connect his anguish to his conversation with the vampire. Mortals, however, don’t expect mind control. The very suspicion seems insane (giving the person another reason to feel depressed). The Kindred know better, so using Despond on them can be dangerous. A vampire who’s in too much of a hurry to converse with her target, but who doesn’t want the weakness of a silent attack, can simply snarl out a few cruel or menacing words to rouse the target’s grief or self-loathing — but the victim definitely knows the vampire tampered with his mind. Even the most skeptical or unwary mortal can’t deny he felt an alien touch in his thoughts.",

Despond’s lesser powers merely work on grief, anxiety and self-loathing already present, helping these feelings overpower the conscious mind in various ways, for a limited time. For Kindred or kine already troubled by thoughts of suicide, however, one use of Despond may push the sufferer over the edge — though he might do the deed nights or weeks later. The more times a victim suffers from Despond, the more likely he will seek suicide.",

The harlots ritually washed the men and women of the temple, bathing them in sacred waters (feet, in particular, were the focus of such consecration). The women also sang lamentations for the fallen, offering whorls of burning incense to both Yahweh and the Queen of Heaven. All of these deeds were meant to call the attention of the divine pair, and focus it on the supplicants.

After his Embrace and during his subsequent journey through unlife, Ioan developed what he called “the Essentiaphagia theory.” In his treatise, which he made available first to the Blue Hand in 1905 and then to the Ordo Dracul in 1913, he posits that Vitae is nourishing to Kindred not because blood contains some mysterious but vital chemical or alchemical ingredient, but because it is charged with the soul — the essentia — of the vessel. Animals, as creations of the Lord, carry enough of this essentia to nourish young Kindred, but God’s curse on vampires quickly develops a more serious appetite, barring them from feeding on lower beasts.",
            "Since ghosts are beings of pure essentia, Dragolescu supposed it would be possible to feed on them directly, not only allowing a vampire to consume a more potent version of Vitae, but sidestepping many of the morale issues of feeding (since a ghosts cannot die again).",
            "The biggest stumbling block for Dragolescu, of course, was that his theorized method of ghost-consumption, called Essentiaphagia, hinged on taking physical sustenance from an incorporeal source. The Blue Hand labored long and hard with this problem, but it wasn’t until Dragolescu spoke with an elder Dragon about the forbidden practice of diablerie that he realized how he could change his theory into a practice. To teach his undead body how to drink an incorporeal soul, he would first consume a soul still housed in a physical body. This epiphany led to the Blue Hand Massacre (see p. XX). Shortly thereafter, Dragolescu began experimenting on ghosts more directly, in ways the covenant had never before seen.",

If the Tismanu achieves enough successes, the subject may not even need to roll to avoid potential frenzy. For example, if the user generates five successes for his subject, even a starving subject can automatically resist Wassail when tasting blood (see Vampire: The Requiem, p. 179).

Most of the rituals have a Victorian Masonic aspect, with implements and precise performance required for their use.",
            "To date, no non-Architect has ever learned the Gilded Cage, as it is one of the bloodline’s most closely guarded secrets. Very few vampires know of its existence as anything other than an odd power, often assuming it a path of the Coils of the Dragon. Teaching an outsider not only gives away power, it gives away secrets that could lead to the bloodline’s undoing. Nearly as importantly, elders use their knowledge of line rituals to keep younger members under their thumb. The only way to learn a new ritual is to be taught it by an elder who has mastered it, so progenitors use the careful doling out of power as a potent method of control.",
            "<b>Cost:</b> Using Gilded Cage always costs one Willpower point. The whole Discipline is based on the idea of imposing one’s will on the world through mystical-scientific research.

Also, because only one Willpower point may ever be spent in a turn, another cannot be spent to augment a Gilded Cage roll unless specified otherwise.",

Items, known as Means, are foci that align the will with the forces channeled. Places, known as Ways, are sites where a pre-existing tendency toward certain phenomena already exists. Any attempt to invoke a Gilded Cage ritual without proper Ways and Means fails automatically. Unlike other forms of vampiric sorcery, however, the Ways and Means used to activate Gilded Cage rituals are not consumed. They can be reused unless specifically noted otherwise. This fact has led some to suggest that Ways and Means are simply props to undead will and not actually mystical tools, but such conjecture defies the Carpenter’s teachings...",
            "Like Crúac and Theban Sorcery, Gilded Cage does not have a linear progression as other Disciplines do. A character’s mastery (dots) dictates the highest level of rituals that he may learn. Rituals are bought with experience points. For example, a character with Gilded Cage 2 can know an unlimited number of one-dot and two-dot rituals (provided the experience points are paid to learn each), but he may not learn any three-dot rituals until his Gilded Cage trait increases to 3. Each time a character acquires a dot in Gilded Cage (including at character creation), he gains a ritual of that level at no additional cost.",

A practitioner can show other Kindred exactly what it feels like to lose mental acuity as a Savage or fear the touch of fire as much as the Mekhet do. Interestingly, though, these powers do not work on the clan to which they correspond, leading Spanos to theorize that all Kindred (even the Ventrue) carry the “seeds” of these weaknesses within them, and that one such “seed” is fully realized in each of the clans (except, of course, the Lords). Therefore, a Daeva cannot fall victim to the Depraved Succubus power, since he is already a slave to his Vices, but can have the seed of vulnerability to fire activated for a short time and thus suffer the Feeble Shadow power.",

Spanos is under the impression that mastery of the Discipline comes with Stupid Savage. The idea that a higher power that mimics the Ventrue clan weakness exists never occurred to him because, to his mind, the Ventrue don’t have a weakness. Likewise, many Deucaliones don’t believe that their Discipline affects other members of the bloodline or even members of clan Ventrue, and don’t bother attempting it. In truth, however, the Discipline works normally on both (except for the Mad Lord power, which no Deucalion to date has manifested anyway).",

On rare occasions, an Alucinor may fail to notice the blissful slumber of someone nearby, or may sense the anguish of a powerful dream from a greater distance. Gazing into the Dreams of the Many does nothing to give a character a sense of a subject’s location. The Sandman simply “swims” through a sea of dreams until he finds pieces of identity that conform to his notion of the desired subject. On some occasions, an Alucinor even gleans bits of prophetic insight from collective dreams.",

            "Born from Morotrophians’ study, infiltration and dependence on isolation, the Institutionalize Discipline manipulates the psychology and physiology of inmates. It’s a proven phenomenon that prisoners and patients can rely so much on the rules of a foundation that they are unable to cope with life on the outside. From excons who commit crimes to get sent back to jail to psychiatric patients who go into convulsions when removed from a hospital, the reaction has been the focus of intense mortal discourse for over a century. No one has studied or understood it more than the Morotrophians. By using the potency of their undead will and blood, Monks are able to control and manipulate this reaction to a degree that mortal tyrants and wardens can only dream of.",
            "Institutionalize is a limited Discipline in some ways; it works under only specific conditions and on specific targets. No Institutionalize power can affect someone who is not part of a confined, defined and regimented social group. Thus, the Discipline cannot be used on a random mortal on the street. Exactly what makes a group vulnerable to Institutionalize is subject to Storyteller interpretation, but there are some general guidelines.",
            "<ul><li>Being bound to a specific and fairly small geographical area with a central meeting/housing location, with ongoing attendance mandated by walls, the will of a leader or by a personal fear.</li><li>Being dependent on other group members in a cyclical love-hate relationship in which certain figures are supposed to act in fairly specific ways (each is assigned a role or duty as in a religious institution, for example).</li><li>Being bound such that a major part of group membership does not have legal control of some major aspect of their own lives. Examples include prison inmates or the mentally ill who are fed, bathed and put to bed on a schedule over which they have no control.</li></ul>",
            "If the majority of these factors apply to a group, chances are good that Institutionalize works on its members. It’s worth noting that many vampiric groups are defined by these guidelines. The courts in Invictus and Lancea Sanctum-dominated cities can be textbook cases, except for their city-wide size, which imposes a - 1 or -2 modifier to activation rolls. (It’s important to note that an individual vampire’s haven does count as an institution.)",
            "Storytellers are encouraged to apply circumstance modifiers to represent how formally institutionalized a group is. An asylum filled with lifelong inmates that’s presided over by an abusive staff may grant as much as a +3 bonus to uses of Institutionalize. A college fraternity with a campus house and a tradition of hazing might barely qualify with a -3 penalty. The cultish and/or tribal groups of other supernatural beings may qualify, depending on how tightly knit and controlling they are. In general, such organizations are esoteric enough to impose a penalty (- 2 to -3) to Discipline rolls.",
            "When Institutionalize works, its effects tend to be pervasive. Many of its powers are able to affect multiple targets without penalty. Applications also combine power with subtly. Most targets are never aware that they’ve been affected by a mystical phenomenon. Those with knowledge of psychology, brain washing or group politics may recognize that some kind of manipulation is at work, but probably have no reason to suspect that it’s “magical” in nature. Short of using Auspex on an Abbot while he uses Institutionalize, there is very little that can be done to prove the mystical nature of Discipline effects. They’re simply an exaggeration of phenomena already at work.",

            "In the Middle Ages, objects called memento mori were treasured as memorabilia of the dearly departed. Some mementos were items the dead had owned in life, such as combs, jewelry or tools, which were decorated by beloved survivors. Other mementos, honoring either specific souls or all the dead folk of the land, were created specifically to remind the living of the dead — or of Death itself — and were prominently displayed in churches throughout Europe. Many medieval mementos featured the dead as skeletal shades of their past themselves or depicted Death himself doing his grisly work. More gruesome mementos show the dead as rotting corpses. In Victorian England, the limits of memento mori expanded again to include photographs of the deceased after their death, typically dressed in their Sunday best and often surrounded by flowers and other serene imagery.",
            "The phrase “memento mori” has various, subtly different meanings. Most often, it is said to mean “remember thy death,” or “remember that you will die.” (A more sentimental translation would be “remember the dead.”) Although the message of a memento mori is sobering and sad, these grim reminders are also meant to remind the living to “get living.”",
            "That the Osites chose to name their mystical tradition of death magic Memento Mori is not surprising, but it does sometimes draw disapproval from Sanctified traditionalists. What is a memento mori to the undead but a reminder of life? What is it to a Sanctified vampire but a temptation to get involved in the affairs of mortals? Such semantic arguments seldom amount to real trouble for Osites, however, as they clearly have little interest in the living.",
            "Instead, the semantics of this Discipline’s name reflects the Osite desire for knowledge of death. The Osites, as a whole, don’t seek to spur on death, circumvent it or even master it. Memento Mori is, foremost, a tool for gaining worldly insight through the study of the dead. With it, an Osite can observe the departed, consult with corpses, draw power from the dead and study the effects of death on others."

For Kindred outside of the bloodline, it’s difficult to discern just how many of the rituals customarily associated with Mortualia are actually essential to its use. When a Libitinarius brushes a scarab amulet with human sweat, is she activating the actual mystic power of the Discipline, or is she merely respecting some ancient tradition? Are the Egyptian words the Libitinarius recites as he lays another Kindred to sleep actually an ancient spell, or is it something the Morticians invented? That no two Libitinarii perform any Mortualia ritual in exactly the same way only further confuses outsiders.",

Although the blood of the Libitinarii has some innate link to the powers of Mortualia, vampires of this line have discovered that the change in the blood necessary to learn the power is not as extreme as that which was necessary to create it. That is, Kindred outside of the Libitinarius bloodline can learn the powers of Mortualia without willing their blood into line with the Morticians. Were this to be commonly known, the Morticians could lose the unique position they have among the Ordo Dracul. For some Libinitarii, the notion that the Discipline’s mystic power would be separated from its cultural traditions is just as unsettling. Kindred of the Libitinarius line are therefore forbidden by their elders from teaching it to those “without the blood.” Still, it is only a matter of time a Mortician does, and draws down the wrath of his vampiric family.",

If it is successful, the victim can act normally for one turn with no modifiers to traits or dice pools.

These days of change are extremely awkward and painful for the vampire, who’s new body may be transformed from that of an infant to that of an old woman in a matter of hours.</li><li>The Asnâm’s new body is effectively Embraced when the vampire’s will usurps it.

            "This Discipline enables the Gethsemani to cause others to suffer wounds similar to those borne by Christ at the time of the Crucifixion. With a single light touch, a Gethsemani seems to imbue a target with a sense of religious rapture that most obviously manifests as open wounds. The Gethsemani, or any other, who imbibes the blood from these wounds discovers that along with any nourishment gained, certain special abilities are passed along. In most cases, the blood augments the drinker’s Strength, Stamina or Dexterity, but the enhancement from some wounds can be less visible, though no less substantial. Gethsemani of exceptional potency are said to have developed even more miraculous uses of Stigmatica, making statues weep blood and similar wonders.",
            "Stigmatica is known to work on mortals alone, though higher levels may be able to affect Kindred and ghouls. To use the Discipline, an Ecstatic need only place his hand briefly on the target and the player spends a Willpower point. (Making such contact invokes the “Touching an Opponent” rules, p. 157 of the World of Darkness Rulebook, assuming a subject resists. If the subject doesn’t resist, touch can be assumed to be automatic if within reach.) The Willpower is still lost if the activation roll for a power fails.",
            "The exertion passes a spark of divinity from the Gethsemani to the target, whose body is overwhelmed by the spiritual transference. One or more wounds spontaneously open and blood begins to flow. The experience is a traumatic one for the kine, who not only endures pain but loses a significant amount of blood. The flow provides certain benefits to vampires or ghouls who drink it, depending on the location of the wound and how much blood is consumed. Typically, the number of successes achieved on the Stigmatica roll determines how many Health points a victim loses to lethal harm. After the equivalent in Vitae has bled, the wounds begin to heal normally. If they are reopened by anything other than a subsequent use of this Discipline, any blood is considered normal and confers no special benefit.",
            "The Gethsemani using a power may not conceal the stigmata he inflicts by licking the wounds after taking his fill. The injuries remain evident and can be healed only naturally or via a supernatural curative proffered by someone or something other than one of the Damned.",
            "A victim of a Stigmatica power is not necessarily forced into acquiescence to feeding. The horror and excessive blood loss of the event can allow him to struggle to survive. For a mortal to resist this kind of Kiss, two or more successes must be achieved on a Resolve + Composure roll, instead of the normal three.",
            "Regardless of how much Health a victim loses — how many successes are rolled for the Gethsemani — the victim does not shed more than the equivalent of one Vitae per turn. If five successes are achieved on the Stigmatica roll, the victim suffers five lethal damage and bleeds for five turns. Thus, no more than one Vitae per turn can be consumed from the victim by means of this power. If blood lost is not consumed in the same turn, it loses its supernatural efficacy. After that point, it is a powerless liquid (it does not even restore spent Vitae if consumed later).",
            "The special benefits gained from drinking empowered blood last for the remainder of the evening, vanishing with sunrise. If an Ecstatic awakens during daylight hours, he does not retain any special powers gained the night before.",
            "Any vampire or ghoul — including the Gethsemani herself — who drinks the blood from a Stigmatica wound may gain its benefits. Only one blood-drinker may do so in a single turn. So, a victim could be passed from drinker to drinker from turn to turn for multiple Kindred to enjoy the results. A mortal victim can be subject to only one Stigmatica power at a time (assuming he survives the first).",
            "No more than one of a drinker’s traits may be enhanced by the Discipline at a given time. A drinker might increase his Strength multiple, cumulative times in an evening by consumption of mystical blood. But if his Strength is currently heightened by Palms of Blood, and he consumes blood ushered by The Dolorous Nail, he loses all bonuses to his Strength and gains only the benefit of the second power (a Dexterity increase). The most recent drinking takes precedent over previous ones where different Attribute increases are concerned. No Attribute can be increased beyond the limit allowed by a character’s Blood Potency as a result of drinking stigmatic Vitae. A vampire with a Blood Potency of 3 is still limited to five Attribute dots.",
            "Despite the claims of most of its practitioners, no definitive proof of Stimatica’s divine nature has been revealed. Certainly there’s a preponderance of evidence to support such a claim, but even Gethsemani who declare no faith in God and who deny the spiritual origins of the Discipline appear to be able to use it. The religious devotion of kine subject to the power seems to make no difference, either. While the faithful find it easy to dismiss such discrepancies, others see them as evidence of something less wholesome at work. Hysterics are quick to lay the blame at the Gates of Hell and regard any application of Stigmatica as an insult and challenge to God. Others of a less fanatic bent simply see a mystery worthy of scholarly consideration. Whatever the opinion, this Discipline creates controversy wherever it’s practiced.",

The vampire may contribute dots in the Totem Merit to a  werewolf pack (see p. 79 of Werewolf: The Forsaken). Each  dot of Sublunario grants the vampire one dot in the Totem Merit, which is only effective when shared with a werewolf pack. The vampire may share in any benefits of the totem-spirit’s  sponsorship  that  are  not  werewolf-specific.  For  example, the vampire may gain a bonus to Skills or Attributes, but can never use Gifts. According to legend, a vampire’s Sublunario connection to a totem spirit can never be changed unless the spirit is broken from the pack. Thus, if the vampire falls out of favor with his honorary pack, he cannot use his Sublunario-granted Totem dots unless his old totem spirit is either destroyed or driven to abandon the pack.</li><li>The vampire must select one of the five phases of the moon when he purchases this Discipline: full, gibbous, half, crescent or new. Under that phase of the moon, the vampire is able to “ride the wave” (see p. 181 of Vampire: The Requiem) without any cost in Willpower. The vampire’s Sublunario dots serve as a bonus to the Resolve + Composure dice pool to goad the Beast in this way. (At the Storyteller’s discretion, additional phases of the moon may be “purchased” by the character for five experience points each.)</li><li>The vampire may roll his Sublunario dots once per scene to gain a bonus on Empathy, Persuade, Intimidate and Social-ize dice pools made with or against werewolves. Each success on this roll grants the vampire a bonus die to dice pools using those Skills. Note that while the vampire’s instinctual behavior is spiritually informed, these bonus dice do not represent any mystic coercion of the werewolves the vampire interacts with — this Discipline affects the vampire, not werewolves.</li><li>The vampire may divide his Sublunario dots as bonus dice between the two “insight Skills” linked with the phase of the moon under which he activates this power. All of the vampire’s Sublunario dots may be placed into a single Skill, if he likes. To re-allocate these bonus dots within the same scene, the vampire must spend another Vitae.

            "The Bohagande regard their inheritance in much the same way that a man living on the frontier might have viewed his rifle. Used properly, it can be the difference between unlife and Final Death. To others, it’s a weapon that seems to inflict harm indiscriminately. Sunnikuse (or “medicine”) is the bloodline’s unique ability to direct the hand of Fate, as dangerous as this practice is. Gifted in the art of stealing luck from others, twisting the outcome of situations to their advantage, and even hoarding good fortune, Bohagande are as deadly and feared as any gunslinger of old. They have an uncanny ability to sense the presence or absence of luck in an individual, and use that knowledge for their own good.",
            "Every application of Sunnikuse, whether it involves a simple touch (as with Jinx) or a momentary gaze (Evil Eye), leaves a victim with a discernible sense of doom. The victim may not always know the source of the sinking feeling (most Bohagande seek to camouflage their depredations with some justifiable charade, such as a game of billiards or Three Card Monty), but she always experiences a terrible sense of unease and impending failure. The greater the potential loss, the more powerful the impression received. Successive uses of Sunnikuse against the same subject only amplify her sensation, eventually convincing any but the most obtuse victim that a Jonah is somehow responsible for her bad luck.",
            "Each time Sunnikuse is used, Wits + Occult is rolled for the subject to recognize that the Jonah is somehow behind her sense of doom. A normal success suggests that there is some vague connection between the Bohagande and the bad luck. An exceptional success fully exposes the Bohagande’s complicity. Perhaps the vampire is even caught with a hand in the proverbial cookie jar, actively doing something strange near or in regard to the intended victim.",
            "There are ways in which a potential victim can protect herself from this Discipline. Most cultures believe that certain items, expressions or practices provide a measure of defense against bad luck. The more involved or complicated the charm, the greater the protection granted. It’s important that the individual truly believes in the power of the charm, however. It is this belief that staves off disaster, not the object itself.",
            "To a Bohagande’s benefit, a host of events, items and circumstances — crossing the path of a black cat, breaking a mirror, walking under a ladder — are ascribed with the power to cause bad luck. If a subject of Sunnikuse is in the vicinity of such circumstances or performs such actions, she is easier to affect with the Discipline. Some Jonahs exploit these superstitions and try to arrange for such ill omens to be present when they use this power, both to increase its usefulness and to provide sources of blame for the ill fortune that befalls a victim.",

If such powers exist, they only work within a Demesne mystically bonded to an Annunaku (see the sidebar).",

Yet Tenure is rumored to have spread beyond the bloodline’s ranks. If the Storyteller agrees, other Kindred, especially in the Invictus, might sometimes learn the Discipline from an Annunaku mentor. The Annunaku bloodline is so old and so widespread that such mentors could feasibly be found in any city. Only an Annunaku can teach the powers of Tenure, however. The Discipline cannot simply be “unlocked” from within one’s own blood, and it cannot be learned secondhand.",
            "Except for the Annunaku, however, not many Kindred learn Tenure. The Discipline is most effective for Kindred who possess established territory where they hunt and influence mortal inhabitants. Most Kindred simply haven’t the wherewithal to build personal domains larger than their own havens. Those Kindred who have, of course, often belong to the Invictus.",
            "<b>Tenure and Obfuscate:</b> Tenure has aspects in common with Auspex. Like that Discipline, Tenure may sometimes penetrate the concealment of Obfuscate, or Obfuscate may sometimes hide a person or object from Tenure. When a character with Tenure attempts to find someone or something hidden by Obfuscate, make a contested roll of the Tenure-user’s Wits + Investigation + Tenure versus the Obfuscate-user’s Resolve + Stealth + Obfuscate. (See the “Clash of Wills” sidebar on p. 119 of Vampire: The Requiem for more about this kind of supernatural contest.) Whoever accumulates the most successes wins the mystical battle. Ties go to the defender. Most of the time, ties result in an Obfuscated object or person remaining hidden (as the Tenure user is the initiator). If a vampire tried using Obfuscate right in front of Kindred with Tenure, however, the hiding character becomes the challenger, since he’s trying to hide himself (or some object) in plain sight."

The Internet is a network because information moves between the nodes. The Internet is a Web-compatible network only when that information moves between human nodes according to the whims and wishes of human participants in the network. Thus, any two websites may not be a part of the same network, for purposes of this Discipline, unless their creators and modifiers are specifically interacting with other human participants that they know.",
            "This is an intuitive ability, not a science. A Lynx may be most fascinated with the information between nodes, but the nodes are most often where she gets her telemetry. A Lynx cannot use Web to instinctually understand any change that is not wrought by human motives, but she can intuit (and eventually anticipate) the flow of passion and information between even distant and unknown human nodes. It is a difficult concept to grasp, even for most Lynx. As a result, many Lynx struggle to quantify their experiences with this Discipline and couch the sensations of its use in dry, scientific or technical terms.",
            "The Internet is only the most obvious and plain example of a network. In fact, for the Lynx, it’s not truly a kind of network at all. It’s really just a medium through which other human networks can be observed. For the purposes of Web, it’s an environment, like a highway or a bar.",
            "Networks rarely have well-defined edges. As a rule of thumb, one large network connected to a second large network by only a few nodes is evidence of two different networks. Similarly, the description of some networks gives an idea of its effective boundaries. The roads of Chicago, for example, connect to the expressways that lead to Detroit, but the expressways are not part of the Chicago road network any more than Detroit is.",
            "It is harder to intuitively understand a larger network, so Kindred with this Discipline tend to interact with smaller networks they believe that they can become intimately familiar with.",
            "For the purposes of this Discipline, there are the following three types of networks:",
            "<b>Formal social networks</b> are of great interest to most Lynx. These networks are made up of the people in an area who do business with one another. These links are primarily financial: who buys from whom, who borrows money from whom, who delivers to whom. These are also links of competition, determined by who competes with whom. Individual final consumers are generally not part of the network; rather, groups of consumers are considered together, as target markets. The substance that flows around the network is, typically, money. This is a cold network, informed by habit and practiced behavior rather than emotional ties. Even for the living, this is a vague, instinctual thing. Formal social networks exist between commuters on the train and regular customers at the store — they are the surface of human networks. In general, this can also be seen as the network of Mental Traits, though Social and Physical factors certainly contribute to the activity of and between nodes.",
            "<b>Personal social networks</b> are composed of nodes of friends, lovers, sexual partners and enemies. In this case, the links are human relationships, and information, conversation, sex, favors, feelings and personal rivalries are the packets of data that flow around the network. This is a deeper, more private network than a formal social network — this is the heart of human networks. Generally speaking, this is the Social network, though Mental and Physical factors certain play a large part in social dynamics.",
            "<b>Spatial networks</b>, such as road, rail and sewage networks, can also be interfaced with by a Lynx. These networks are typically more static and evidentiary than social networks, but that’s not always the case. Though a Lynx attuned to spatial networks may be able to infer the function and meaning of buildings, roads and pipes constructed by human agents, she is better able to mingle with the movement within those systems, slipping into crowds, influencing the flow of traffic and predicting where a human or car will change direction. This is the most Physical network of the lot, as it casts the actual human body as the information that travels between man-made nodes.",
            "A Lynx can only use the powers of Web in the types of networks with which she is attuned. Every Lynx attunes to one of the three network types automatically upon developing the first dot of Web. Attunement to an additional network types can be acquired by spending five experience points. A Lynx cannot be attuned to more types of networks than she has dots in Web.",
            "Most of these powers work with any creature who participates in human relationships, from ghouls to vampires to mages. As a general guideline, creatures with a Morality or similar Trait rated two or less cannot be affected by this Discipline. Spatial networks may contest eligible powers with a Resistance Trait value that reflects the average traffic through the space, as determined by the Storyteller."

            "This power doesn’t give a Lynx much information on the network in general, but it provides the tools for investigating networks and assembling a map of their nodes. The information the vampire gains is full of strong sensations and mental images, tempered by the biases and experiences of his subject node. Thus the information received is accurate only to a point. However, when tracing a lead on information to an adjacent node in the same network, the Lynx instinctually realizes that she has made contact with a specific associate node.",
            "For example, when a Lynx attuned with personal networks “scans” a mortal woman, she might learn that she is currently infatuated with a blond man and experiencing what feels like a bad break-up with a co-worker. If the Lynx encounters the woman’s “blond man” and scans him, the vampire instinctually understands that she has found the man the mortal woman is infatuated with. The Lynx may also learn that the blond man does not love her back.",
            "What constitutes a node of any particular network type is open to some interpretation by the Storyteller. A personal node is always a person, and the interface with a personal node must always be through direct social contact, whether that means a formal interview, flirtations at a crowded restaurant or small talk on the subway. A formal node requires direct observation of the subject by the vampire, though contact is not necessary — trailing the subject is typical. A spatial node must be a junction or intersection on some sort of physical network, such as a freeway interchange, a telephone junction box or a boiler room, and must be visited in person by the Lynx for the scan to work."

This information may seem to be gleaned by subtleties of behavior (“See the way he’s eyeballing that dress? He was just thinking about buying it for someone. Someone with red hair.”) or attitude (“He’s pissed. Look at him. He hates his boss.”), but that is often just a trick of the blood. The information is often gleaned directly by vaguely sensing the subject’s psychic presence.",
            "Alternately, the character can learn something about the subject’s Social Merits. To use this option, the Lynx must select a Merit to gauge — Allies, Contacts, Herd, Mentor or Retainer, for example — and then compare the successes on her activation roll to the subject’s dots in that Merit. The Lynx gets an intuitive understanding of the Merit in question, up to a value equal to the successes scored. For example, if a Lynx scores three successes on her activation roll, she can learn about as many as three of the subject’s dots in Contacts; if the subject as five dots of Contacts, two of those dots would go unread by the Lynx unless she tried to scan the subject again and achieved a greater result. Generally speaking, a Lynx first learns about the contacts and connections the subject is most comfortable with.",

            "A vampire is a creature of the real world, the solid world where hot blood flows from the veins of the kine into the Kindred’s mouths. There may be more ethereal places in the complex world, but if there’s no blood there, why bother? Some Kindred find a reason. There are secrets there to be ferreted out, escape routes to lay, allies and dupes to be found and, most important to some, advantage to be had over other Kindred. A vampire with this power learns how to step sideways through the cracks between worlds, going from the physical world to the Shadow Realm or vice versa. At a locus, he focuses his will and forces himself through the Gauntlet.",
            "While in the Shadow Realm, the vampire has to worry about all that place’s dangers. Spirits (and their greater cousins, the gods of the realm) are as great a threat to Kindred as they are to humans. Worse, there is no blood for a vampire to consume. The vampire still must spend a point of Vitae to continue functioning each day, and thus has some sense of time, but the urge to sleep at daybreak vanishes. Vampires who spend too long in the Shadow would do well to ask a spirit the time of day before returning to the physical world, assuming the locus they are using to travel is not sealed away from the sunlight.",
            "Luckily, there are some advantages. The spirit world is called the Shadow because it is largely a realm of night. A vampire does not need to fear the sun in most places there. There are some — and one can happen upon them without warning — where the sun is strongly reflected in the Shadow Realm’s sky. These are sunburned deserts, some tropical regions and other places with a strong solar resonance. The sun’s symbolism is just as dangerous to the Kindred as the sun’s rays, and a vampire must be wary of them."

The vampire invites a spirit into her cold flesh to form an unholy synthesis, something not Man, not Beast and not spirit. This is a dangerous proposition for both entities, because it gives each a measure of control over the power that results. The body remains that of the vampire, with access to all the vampire’s Vitae and Disciplines (and weaknesses), but it gains some features that reflect the spirit. Joining with a flame-spirit (which would be a terrifically bad idea) would redden the vampire’s hair, lend some heat to the body’s flesh and occasionally leave the faintest smoke contrails. Spirits of less physical things are less obvious: taking in a greed-spirit might change the vampire’s eye-color to green.",
            "While sharing one form, the vampire and spirit act as one. They both perceive everything the body perceives, and their wills are assumed to be aligned. The two take only a single action (as normal for a character) on any given combat turn. Anything one wishes to do that the other does not oppose is done. For example, a spirit who wishes to breathe in and smell the local aroma through the vampire’s nose may do so, as long as the vampire doesn’t want to keep from breathing. When there is a conflict, the character rolls Resolve + Composure + Blood Potency in contest against the spirit’s Power + Finesse. The victor determines the action for that turn. Should the two tie, the body hesitates under its uncertain control and takes no action for the turn. This delay occurs even if the contested action would normally be reflexive (like inhaling). This is one of many reasons it is vastly important for a vampire and spirit to work out their goals ahead of time.",

Any Numen that does not require the spirit to be ephemeral (as Claim or Possession do). The spirit also cannot use Discorporate or other Numina that would separate it from the merged form until the vampire releases it or it forces its way out.

Not only is the character not able to regain Willpower through his Virtue, he behaves as if no Virtue particularly matters to him.</li><li>A victim may be made to forget she has any experience with a particular Skill or Merit. A doctor can be made to repress all her medical knowledge. A Carthian can be made to forget his allegiance to the covenant.

The Society called this Psychogenic Instrumentation — Booth was, after all, their instrument, and they had tuned his mind to an entirely new neurological frequency. It was this preternatural attunement (later shorted to Psychogenics) that was the greatest achievement of the Tiresian Society, along with their grim innovations in mind control.",

Kindred blood is already powerful; its crimson puissance carries a great deal of ingrained supernatural possibilities. But Booth was the carrier of his own strange powers. His body was weak, but his mind was frighteningly strong. And, with the emptying out of his mortal blood and the infusion of cursed Vitae, his powers not only became stronger, but they could be passed along to others, coded with the very Sleeper program that was Morning’s transcendent legacy.",
            "This practice of Psychogenics lives on now in the blood of Sleepers as a Discipline available only to them. This Discipline is about the psychic potential of the mind. It is not merely about extrasensory perception or one mind’s power over another. It is about raw potential, about the strength of one’s own psychic control over his environment, his body and even the bodies of others. It is deeply ingrained in the Sleeper program, and is well suited to the dark needs of the Seventh Day.",

Note, however, that such investigation should in no way immediately point to VII or mind-control. It’s not as if the local libraries contain an encyclopedia of vampire powers and their associated covenants and bloodlines. New Disciplines are rare, but often talked about in occult circles — consider that bloodlines may have their own signature Disciplines that go unknown among most Kindred for years.
