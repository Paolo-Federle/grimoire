        "LongDescription": [
            "Allies are people who are willing to help your character from time to time. They may be associates, friends of convenience or people who owe your character a favor. Each acquisition of this Merit is dedicated to one type of ally, whether in an organization, society or circle. Examples include the police, City Hall, criminals, unions, banks, university faculty and hospital staff. In order to have alliances in more than one venue, you need to purchase this Merit multiple times, each trait with its own dots. Thus, your character might have Allies (Police) ••, Allies (Criminals) ••• and Allies (City Hall) •, each acquired separately at character creation or during play.",
            "Each dot that your character has indicates how deep his influence runs in that group. One dot might mean he can ask for minor favors, such as being spared a parking ticket if alliance is among police, or being allowed to see an article before it goes to press if alliance is among reporters. Three dots garner considerable favors, such as a building permit “going missing” at City Hall, or a strike resolution being wrapped up early among union leaders. Five dots allow for dangerous and even overtly criminal favors, such as a stock being sabotaged on Wall Street or the answers to an exam being shared by a university professor.",
            "The kinds of requests made of people in an organization typically have to relate to their sphere of influence. Asking a criminal to slow down the bureaucratic process at City Hall makes no sense, but asking him to pass along word of a drug buy does. Favors might be minor and within the bounds of a person’s job or role, such as processing some paperwork more quickly than usual, or could be significant or dangerous and outside what’s allowed or even legal, such as allowing a civilian access to the police evidence locker.",
            "The Storyteller has final say over what is an acceptable request and what is not. If there’s any doubt, the Storyteller could call for a Manipulation + Persuasion roll, with a bonus equal to your character’s Allies dots. Penalties might also apply based on the importance or danger of the request. Asking someone to do something already in the bounds of their role imposes no modifier, while asking them to do something that could get them suspended imposes a -3 penalty, and asking for something that could get them jailed or killed is -5. Frequent favors asked of the same group also imposes a penalty as group members grow tired of being called upon.",
            "Similarly, a roll of Manipulation + Persuasion + Allies dots could determine how many police answer your character’s call for help, or how many longshoremen turn up when your character needs a show of force (one per success rolled).",
            "Allies doesn’t have to be defined in terms of specific individuals over whom your character has sway. He could simply know a variety of people among city reporters and he can call upon them in general from time to time. You should, however, explain why your character has influence in a particular body. Maybe he worked there himself at one time and still has friends in the organization. Or he has done a group a favor and its members still owe him.",
            "<b>Drawback:</b> Allies are not automatons, waiting for your character to ask for help. They have their own lives and needs. An alliance is a two-way relationship. Calling for favors makes your character indebted to his friends, and they are sure to call such favors in when they need help. The Storyteller can use such debts as inspiration for future stories."

        "LongDescription": [
            "As beings that live for centuries and can die and later return to life, purified regularly require new legal identities. All purified are assumed to have a single legal identity and need pay no Merit dots for this privilege. However, if the purified has lived in a single legal identity for more than two decades, your character has almost certainly begun to have to use various minor forms of disguise to change his appearance so that it better matches his legal age.",
            "Having a second identity allows purified to have an identity that matches his apparent age and it also allows him to easily vanish if any legal questions arise surrounding his activities. In addition, if your character’s body dies in such a way that others notice his death, he can use this alternate identity if there is no way for him to explain his perceived death. However, modern background checks, paper trails and bureaucratic scrutiny make acquiring a new identity far more difficult than it was in the past. Few characters have the skills to create a new identity for themselves. The vast majority must look for help, either from older and more experienced purified or from some mortal or supernatural source who is skilled in the various complex and highly illegal methods of acquiring such documents.",
            "The number of dots spent on this Merit determines how convincing and in-depth the documentation surrounding this new life actually is. Alternate Identity (●) represents an identity that passes casual inspection, but not much else  a character can go shopping and get around in most daily situations, but any kind of trained scrutiny such as from a police officer or bureaucrat immediately identifies this identity as a fake. Alternate Identity (●●) creates an identity that will pass most forms of relatively cursory professional inspection, but cannot stand up to a sustained investigation.",
            "A police officer that pulls your character over will not automatically pick up anything unusual if she runs the character’s license plates or calls up his name in a database. However, if your character is arrested and the police begin a formal investigation his identity will quickly unravel. Alternate Identity (●●●●) represents an identity that is essentially as real as any identity can be  it takes a truly dedicated, competent and time-consuming search by trained professionals to uncover any hint that the purified isn’t exactly who he claims to be, at least as far as his documentation is concerned.",
            "This Merit may be purchased multiple times at multiple ratings, each time representing a different identity. Also, an identity may also be upgraded later with the appropriate in-game explanation and experience expenditure. In the case of certain Merits such as Resources or Status, it might also be worth noting to which identity these Merits are tied, since a character may not easily be able to access or maintain them if that identity is compromised.",
            "<b>Drawback:</b> Although one-dot Alternate Identities require no maintenance, both of the more thorough versions do. If someone checks on a legal identity, they will immediately become suspicious if the person has no legal address or magazine subscriptions, pays no taxes and has no phone number. Similarly, if all of this data exactly matches your character’s primary legal identity, many people soon realize both of these identities belong to the same individual. Therefore, your character must take time and spend money to maintain any two or four-dot Alternate Identities.",
            "Having the identity make frequent trips to remote locations and similar inventive dodges can reduce the frequency of this maintenance. The amount of maintenance needed to keep a two-dot identity looking legitimate is fairly minimal, requiring only a few hours of work every month.",
            "However, keeping a four-dot identity believable requires at least several hours of work every week. Failure to perform this upkeep on an identity causes it to be reduced to the next lowest level. However, alternate identities never fall lower than one dot. Paying Experience Points to upgrade an identity represents the effort needed to build it back up. Characters can also pay criminal organizations to maintain alternate identities, but doing so causes its own problems, including both the cost and the possibility of blackmail."

Similar to the Retainer Merit, Animal Companion reflects a single beast who loyally follows your character. This creature could be your breed-kin, but she doesn’t have to be. It’s possible she’s an old pet or new partner who’s not spooked by the beast-blood’s changing skin.",
            "To purchase the Merit, you must decide the backstory between your feral and his friend. Does their bond predate the First Change? If so, how old is the animal now, and how did their affinity survive her “master’s” new life? Is this a new companion, and if so, how did the normal animal bond with the shapechanging beast? Whatever their tale might be, this companion is smart, useful and independent. A rat in a cage or a dog in the yard isn’t a Merit — she’s a pet.",
            "The dots in this Merit reflect the animal’s power, intellect and often size. The higher the trait, the more capable the companion. A one-dot beast could be a smart rat or clever bird, a two-dot Merit might reflect a loyal (if finicky) cat, three points could buy a common-looking but brilliant companion such as Lassie or Trigger; at the top of the scale, the companion stands out in any setting — a tiger, bear, dolphin or chimpanzee whose physical and mental capacity would be impressive even if she weren’t devoted to her apparent “master.”",
            "Unless the Animal Companion is driven off by poor treatment or otherwise killed, she remains a loyal element in the character’s life. She will do whatever she can to assist him, and regard him with the ultimate affection. The details, naturally, depend on her species — a devoted cat or loyal snake won’t show devotion the way a dog might. Still, unless that bond is severed by death or abuse, the Animal Companion is yours for life. (If this “Merit” is killed off, all points regarding her are lost.)",
            "<b>Drawback:</b> Unlike the Retainer Merit, an Animal Companion is just that: an animal. She won’t have free access to Man’s world, and remains limited by manual dexterity, mental perspective and social rules. Lassie may be a great dog, but she still can’t drive to the bank and cash a check.",
            "Powerful animals are often exotic, too, and they stand out on a city street. Most places have laws against horses in public, and almost all human societies regulate private “ownership” of tigers, bears and so forth. The beast may spook other animals, and will probably follow her instincts if prey happens to be nearby. Loyal as she might be, this friend retains her bestial habits and needs; she might trash an office, eat a garden or throw feces at the cops if that’s what seems natural. Your feral might adore his companion, but a smart, powerful animal remains a high-maintenance friend."
