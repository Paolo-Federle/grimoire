            <h3>A note on cost</h3>
            <div>
                The Costs of the items in the Armory book have been calculated roughly according to the following principle: 
                an item has a given Cost if a character with the Resources Merit at that level could purchase the item with 
                no more than half his monthly disposable income. To attach approximate numbers to this, Cost • is anything 
                up to $250, Cost •• is up to $500, Cost ••• is up to $1,000, Cost •••• is up to $5,000 and Cost ••••• is 
                up to $25,000 and beyond. The price tags of vehicles have been divided by 60 to account for five-year 
                monthly payment plans. This system can help you determine what Cost to assign a real-world item when 
                giving it traits in the Storytelling System, as well as a rough idea of just how many items of Cost •• a 
                character with Resources 3 can afford in a single month, should you wish to deal with item acquisition 
                on such an in-depth level.
